1,"Ukraine and the ‘New Cold War: The Return of Neutralism","2014-06-04 00:00:00","Matt Finucane",null,"Whether the Crimean crisis heralds a new era of international relations (or not), it has clearly been a pivotal moment in Russia’s relationship with the West. The world over balances of power are shifting, and though the United States remains unrivalled in sheer power, close to the borders of rising China and the increasingly-assertive Russia (each allegedly emboldened by Obama’s vacillations in Syria and Ukraine), grey areas are emerging. For those states most vulnerable to these ‘revisionist powers’ (those most alarmed by Obama’s ‘hands-off approach’), the policy of ‘neutralism’ appears increasingly worthy of revival. Neutralism defined a Cold War foreign policy pioneered by Finland and later adopted by Josip Tito’s Yugoslavia, following his split with Stalin in 1948. When geographically sandwiched between two antagonistic blocs, neutralism prescribed balanced relationships with each side. As such, neutral states reaped rewards otherwise reserved for paid-up members of either bloc, and enjoyed a modicum of security in knowing that both blocs considered their mutual neighbour’s neutralism preferable to its defection to the other side. In this sense Yugoslavia was archetypal. Tito’s split with Stalin had been so volcanic that none foresaw rapprochement (one exchange featured Tito imploring Stalin to “Stop sending people to kill me”, then teasing his paranoia: “If you don’t stop sending killers”, he wrote, “I’ll send one to Moscow, and I won’t have to send a second”). Yugoslavia’s ensuing isolation saw its economy decimated by a Soviet embargo. Nevertheless, seeing in Yugoslavia a thorn in the flesh of Communist unity, its trade deficits were quickly soaked up and economy kept afloat by generous Western loans. With the Balkan Pact in 1953, Yugoslavia became entwined with two NATO members, Greece and Turkey, thus affording it some relief from the very real threat of Soviet intervention, without necessitating its formal NATO membership. From here, a rapprochement with the new Khrushchёv regime was possible, and an ostensibly socialist Yugoslavia prospered in the grey area between the messianic empires. The lynchpin of neutralism was that both blocs needed an interest in the subject’s continued ‘independence; the crushing of Hungary’s 1956 revolution (while the West looked elsewhere) was testament to the paucity of this circumstance. Therefore in Ukraine, where both Russia and the West vie for influence, it’s not surprising that President-elect, Petro Poroshenko, has already indicated a willingness to rekindle relations with Russia, and perhaps even limit Ukraine’s military activities against its pro-Russian ‘Donetsk People’s Republic’ in exchange for closer ties with Vladimir Putin. If the commentary that abounded shortly after Ukraine’s crisis began (and after Russia and the West declared their implacable allegiance to opposing sides) is to be believed, and a new Cold War is truly on the rise, then now more than ever a policy of neutralism offers intermediary states unique bounties. There is little doubt now that Ukraine will seek further European Union integration—a definitive blow to Russia’s Eurasian Economic Union that will likely come into effect (without Ukraine) in January 2015. Economic stability is surely Poroshenko’s primary interest and, put simply, the EU offers the best means to achieve that. However, while his West-leaning electorate would never countenance a rebalance towards Russia, an exclusive alliance with the EU and IMF might similarly threaten the recovery agenda underpinning his presidency. The IMF has already warned that major reforms of the Ukrainian economy will be necessary—a potential ‘unemployment nightmare’, and likely to hit Ukrainians’ traditional energy subsidies—the period of austerity may well leave Ukraine again relying on Russia for stability—a gross irony considering the present bloodshed in the East. Having sworn to eliminate the insurgency in not two or three months but hours, a long-foreseen concession on autonomy seems the likely means to defuse this situation. This would be a victory for Russia and pro-Russians alike, and Putin recognises this—evident in his stated readiness “for a dialogue with Petro Poroshenko” where previously Ukraine’s government was denounced as an illegitimate junta. Though some might decry this a surrender to a self-evidently nasty regime, two problems (of which they’re likely aware) present themselves: none are willing to wage war over strategically-lukewarm Ukraine; nor are any states eager to take full responsibility for its moribund economy. With the weight of IMF restructuring hanging heavily, coupled with the threat of a Russian gas cut-off, to Ukraine’s nascent government neutralism’s likely never looked so appealing.

2,"Guest Post: China and the Crimea Conundrum","2014-03-12 00:00:00","Matt Finucane",null,"With the EU-US alliance’s imposition of heavy sanctions on Russia over its de facto annexation of Crimea, the world is now looking to Russia’s perceived long-term strategic ally China to deliver a breakthrough in the diplomatic deadlock that has emerged between Putin and the West. While many analysts were expecting China to side with Russia on account of their track record of UN Security Council veto alignment, or even because Russian expansion might set a precedent for an eventual Taiwan takeover, so far Beijing has issued a series of statements that can perhaps most aptly be described as non-committal. Above all else, China has urged the involved parties to refrain from escalating the situation with violence, stating that “the situation in Ukraine is extremely complex” and that “an open attitude” is key to resolving the conflict. Indeed, Beijing’s diplomatic rhetoric in this unfolding crisis has been rather opaque, hinting perhaps more than anything at a desire to ‘stay out of it’ – which would altogether be an understandable wish considering the already generous amount of political turmoil on Beijing’s plate (e.g. last week’s North Korean missile launches, the Uighur knife attack, territorial tensions in SE Asia). Meanwhile, Chinese newspapers, known for their jingoist language and widely considered to be mouthpieces of the CCP, have been less subtle: according to them, the West is stuck in a “Cold War mentality”, exacerbating the situation with their threats of sanctions and overly bellicose language. Still, all things considered, China has generally kept a low profile throughout this crisis, and doesn’t seem particularly eager to abandon its position of neutrality anytime soon. Even so, China did allegedly publicly speak out against the Russian incursion into Crimea last week, citing the necessity to respect Ukraine’s “sovereignty and territorial integrity” as the reason for doing so. This statement is concordant with Beijing’s long-term pattern of categorically opposing any political measure that oversteps national boundaries, recent examples of which are China’s UNSC vetoes against military action in the Libya and Syria crises. What the language of the Chinese statements also closely mimics, however (and what many analysts tend to overlook), is the Chinese response to the Russia-Georgia conflict of 2008, which ended in Russia declaring the pro-Russia territories of South Ossetia and Abkhazia independent. In 2008, China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Qin Gang stated: We have a knowledge of the complicated history and reality of the South Ossetia and Abkhazia issues. In accordance with China’s consistent and principled stance on issues of this kind, we hope the relevant parties can resolve the issue through dialogue and consultation. Replace ‘South Ossetia and Abkhazia’ with ‘Crimea’, and this statement could have been issued just yesterday. Given their history, China’s current stance thus really shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone. Still, China’s insistence that territorial integrity should be respected appears to be at considerable odds with their own claims to several territories, notably Taiwan and the Diaoyu/Senkaku islands in the South China Sea. Why then should we consider China’s gratuitous wilsonianisms as anything other than tu quoque fallacies? And why should China even care about what Russia does in the first place, much less imperil their strategic cooperation with the fellow communist country by explicitly voicing their displeasure? There are any number of discernable reasons as to why China could be irked over the Crimea situation, among them not wanting to sour trade relations with the West, or even the$10 billion nuclear pact Chinese president Xi Jinping signed with Ukraine’s Yanukovich on December 5, 2013, which was part of China’s plan to establish a “nuclear umbrella” of its own. Realistically, though, trade relations with the West would probably not have suffered had China remained silent, and the ousting of Yanukovich — however convenient for Putin — was not instigated by the Kremlin. The most important reason behind China’s subtle denouncement of Putin’s move into Crimea is most likely of a wholly different nature, and can be explained by looking at Russia’s treatment of the Tatars of Crimea. Last week, big X’s suddenly started appearing on the front doors of many Crimean Tatars, the indigenous muslim inhabitants of Crimea. The marks were left by gangs of Kremlin apologists, and they invoked a particularly nasty episode in Crimean Tatar history: in 1944, Stalin had his police force carve X’s in the doors of Crimean Tatars, after which they were promptly deported from the peninsula. This time around, the marks were left as a warning, dissuading Tatars — who, post-Stalin, constitute only a small minority on the peninsula—from voting pro-Ukraine in the upcoming referendum. The Tatars have responded in varying ways, some fleeing Crimea, while others have banded together in groups to patrol their neighborhoods. Although it is not clear whether Russian troops or rather civilians were the ones to mark the doors, Putin has done nothing to mitigate the resulting unrest among the Tatars. Instead, he has reiterated his line of protecting the ethnically Russian majority of Crimea on several occasions, exacerbating ethnic tensions and indicating that the minorities simply aren’t of particular importance to him. But they are to China. Much like in 2008, Putin has fashioned the narrative underlying his expansionist maneuver into Crimea on the basis of ethnicity, rather than territory. The reason why China objected to South Ossetian and Abkhazian independence then, and is objecting to Crimean independence now, is not because it doesn’t set a precedent for uncontested expansion into historical territory – it is because it sets the wrong kind of precedent. Rather than paving the way for a Chinese incursion into Taiwan, a territory to which China argues to have a historical claim, it underlines and legitimates the political cleavages between ethnicities. This runs directly counter to the CCP’s domestic policy, which has historically been to nip all claims to independence made by ethnic minorities (of which over 55 exist in China) firmly in the bud – lest China go down the same road as the Soviet Union. Beijing has been very crafty in carrying out this policy, using sanctions and even arranging mass immigrations of Han Chinese to minority-dominated areas to gradually dilute manifestations of minority culture, but the administration nonetheless regularly meets with passionate resistance. The most famous example of resistance to this policy of establishing a Chinese monoculture is perhaps Tibet, but the Uighurs – who reside in the Xinjiang area – have been even more prolific in voicing their disgruntlement, and the recent knife attack certainly shouldn’t be considered an isolated incident. Map of China by ethnic distribution A look at the above ethnic map of China immediately explains why the CCP is so determined about curbing ethnic tensions and keeping China unified: even though the ethnic minorities only make up about 9% of the Chinese population, they inhabit a large land mass of China – the most important parts of which, Tibet and Xinjiang, coincidentally have important strategic value. The Chinese are famously strapped for resources, and as it turns out, Xinjiang is home to particularly large oil, gas and mineral deposits. Xinjiang also has pipelines running through it that supply China with valuable oil, and the region provides direct access to many resource-rich neighboring countries. Tibet, on the other hand, has valuable forest and fresh water resources to supplement their mineral deposits, on which China as a whole is heavily dependent. Control of the Tibetan plateau additionally represents political leverage in South East Asia, simply because of the fact that many of the rivers that run through neighboring countries originate there. Besides these resources, the Tibet and Xinjiang regions also represent huge geopolitical benefits. The two regions fence off China from India and the Central Asian countries, and their rugged mountain ranges provide an additional layer of protection against potential military invasions from the outside. From a trade perspective, having control over Tibet and Xinjiang means having land routes to the Persian Gulf states, which are among China’s main oil suppliers. Absent these, China would be forced to open up more circuitous avenues of sea trade, which are both more vulnerable and more costly. All in all, then, China would suffer huge losses strategically, financially and from a natural resources point-of-view if the Tibetans and Uighurs were to secure their independence, and it is from this perspective that we should understand China’s domestic policy: the Chinese have no option but to downplay the importance of ethnicity. In Crimea, the Chinese recognize yet another example of a state breaking down because of a dominant ethnicity claiming independence in one of its constituent regions, and this is exactly the kind of precedent China is not willing to help set.

3,"Power vs. Interest: Ukraine’s Dwindling Options","2014-03-02 00:00:00","Matt Finucane",null,"Predictions regarding Ukraine’s future following a Russian invasion (in all but name) abound, and while almost all expect bloodshed, some go as far as to predict the forthcoming apocalypse. Amidst such exclamations there have been few moderate voices, Stephen Walt and Medhi Hassan represent an inconspicuous minority. But, if one is to forgive the generalisation that most international events (especially of this ilk) are horrendously overblown and, following their conclusions, only remembered by wonks and their victims—in Ukraine, surely when no shots have been fired more moderate expectations might be appropriate? Indeed, the great majority of prognoses simplify or take no notice of what Putin’s aims might be. Fundamentally, the avoidance of conflict is to his favour—it is important to note that Ukrainian military installations were occupied, not shelled, as is the traditional practice. An optimal situation would be a successful referendum (already demanded on the 27th of February) under the auspices of Russian occupation, then the transferral of Crimea to either sovereign status akin to Abkhazia and South Ossetia (the breakaway regions of Georgia, recognised by Russia and few others following their 2008 war) or to gradual membership of the Russian Federation. All that stands in the way is the potential for a NATO, EU, or Ukrainian response. Given their nascent administration, the likelihood of Ukraine attacking Russian forces is slim without steadfast assurance of Western help. Though Poland and Lithuania, both ex-Soviet states, have called for an emergency meeting of NATO claiming (with some basis) that their security interests are threatened, a strong international response would be a considerable divergence from the indefatigable mainstay of limp responses: Tough Talks™. The situation in Ukraine is, to use an otherwise avoided cliché, testament to Putin’s aptitude for Machiavellian politics. As another commentator wrote, “Whatever else one might think about Putin, he has done the world a favour reminding us how international politics really work.” In a world in which the structure of international norms make territorial land-grabs a political faux pas, Putin has delivered a crisis from which he’ll likely reap the benefits (not only Crimea, but again painting the EU and NATO as impotent), having dressed it as best he can as Kosovo in reverse—a unilateral partition as requested by the populace. As Stephen Walt writes, Ukraine is a “classic tradeoff,” for while the US is stronger overall, “Russia cares more and is right next door. It’s power vs. interest, & here interest trumps.” CC image courtesy of Taras Gren, Wikimedia.

4,"Hanging in the Balance: Ukraine’s Russian Republic","2014-03-01 00:00:00","Matt Finucane",null,"Over the past four or so months, Ukraine has witnessed protest and rioting that dwarfs its 2004 Orange Revolution in every respect. Beginning as a protest against what was seen as undue Russian influence in Ukraine’s last-minute withdrawal from an Association Agreement with the European Union, this volte-face in favour of closer Russian association soon came to encompass government corruption, ill-treatment of protesters, and the oppressive response of the Yanukovich government. Confronted with harrowing scenes such as those displayed below, the parliamentary ousting of Yanukovich prompted an international sigh of relief. However, a new conflict, brewing in the country’s southerly Crimea, threatens far-reaching and international consequences as Russia weighs up the merits of military involvement. In this majority Russian region, granted the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1954, unrest has been percolating since it first became clear that Yanukovich’s days were numbered. Here the East-West cultural divide is more marked than anywhere in Ukraine, 59 per cent of the population identifying as Russian (compared to only 24 per cent Ukrainian), and typically holding pro-Moscow and anti-European sentiments—the ubiquity of the Russian tricolour at these events bearing testament to this. Nevertheless, a Russian hand is suspected—from the allegedly “pre-paid” protests, to the gunmen that stormed governmental buildings nights ago. As this publishes, the Russian government passes a bill to fast-track the annexation of foreign territory and the distribution of Russian citizenship. The last time such measures were taken was in the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Georgia. The granting of citizenship, seemingly to any Abkhazians that applied, legitimised the Russian claim (as spelled out in the Defence Doctrine of 2010) to be protecting Russian citizens from harsh treatment at the hands of the (West-leaning) Georgian government. Nevertheless, comparisons with Georgia are more convenient than accurate, for while the Georgian War began on certain terms with the Georgian shelling of South Ossetia, Russian activities in Ukraine take place in a contractually grey area. Their port at Sevastopol allows for the troop movements and exercises widely documented in the last few days, though the seizure of airports and other administrative buildings is more clear cut. Another comparison, made frequently whenever ethnic tensions arise, is with the former Yugoslavia. Though these tensions are without a doubt genuine, and just as in Yugoslavia were lighted by a political spark, the absence of any historical grievance or mythology so overbearing in the Yugoslav Wars of the ’90s makes nonsense of the claims that ethnic cleansing is imminent. The key to understanding the situation in Ukraine is an appreciation for Russia’s military doctrine of recent years—some parts old, and warranting the Cold War lens so prevalent in Western analyses, and others new, reflecting Russia’s rising ambitions in international affairs. Firstly, though the Soviet Union dissipated in 1991, the appeal of buffer states—enshrined since the Second World War as a ‘no man’s land’ between Russia and its adversaries—endures, and Ukraine is perhaps the greatest of them. Secondly, having just recently announced plans for naval bases as far abroad as Venezuela and Singapore, the loss of the home of perhaps its proudest naval asset, the Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol, Ukraine—especially given the precarious situation of its only Mediterranean port in Tartus, Syria—would be untenable. That such a fate might befall Russia less than a year after announcing its plans to field a permanent global naval presence might only add insult to injury. What the future holds for Ukraine and Crimea is uncertain. The impact of the revolution on its economy is considerable, and the turn to the West will necessitate painful economic austerity as mandated by the IMF—a stark contrast to the comfortable fuel subsidies afforded allies of Moscow, the largest energy supplier in the region. Whether a full-scale invasion will take place (a creeping, non-declaratory takeover seems more likely), and indeed whether the opposition has any available means to prevent it (including foreign assistance), is yet to be seen. All signs point to an assertive Russia that would still rather avoid scandal. Nevertheless, the situation in Crimea already sets an incredible precedent and will have profound consequences for the future of the post-Cold War world.

5,"Two Very Different Wars on Terrorism: How the Cold War Haunts Collaboration","2014-02-03 00:00:00","Matt Finucane",null,"On the 29th of December, at 12:40 Moscow Time, an explosion gutted the entrance to Volgograd’s central train station leaving eighteen dead and forty-four injured. The explosion was recorded on CCTV, the shockwave rocking the camera while those civilians visible scatter from the blast. The very next morning a trolleybus erupted in the Dzerzhinsky district, killing a further sixteen dead and leaving forty-one injured. The latest of many attacks in Russia’s recently turbulent past, they—like most others—failed to pierce international consciousness in such a way as, for example, the (lesser) Boston Marathon Bombings of April 2013. While the hashtag #prayforBoston became a global phenomenon (and still bears regular recital), even on the days of the bombings, tweets concerning Volgograd hardly transcended the Russian border[i]. This represents no substantial divergence from the norm, for while terrorist attacks on the West and its allies are neatly categorised as generic attacks on liberty itself, attacks on Russian soil take on a very different character. Immediate blame is attributed, in this case to (speculatively dead) Chechen Islamist, Doku Umarov; his motive: the recognition of the Caucasus Emirate as a state distinct from the Russian Federation. Comparatively, while responsibility for the September 11th attacks was rapidly attributed to Osama bin Laden (an invasion force sallied forth weeks later), few have read his “letter to the American people,” nor watched his 2004 Al-Jazeera tape in which his motives are clearly expounded. A plethora is offered, the most recurrent being: support for the state of Israel and its part-genocidal invasion of Lebanon, the United Nations sanctions against Iraq (recognised as having caused not less than 400,000 child deaths), and the supporting of various unsavoury regimes to maintain a steady flow of cheap materials. That stumbling upon these well-published testimonies—upon which a fourteen-year war was predicated—evokes a similar feeling to unearthing some forgotten and long-sought document is a failure of not only the media, but the system it inhabits. The effect of obfuscating why the West was attacked, while paying due attention when such terrors befall others, rids us of the onus to address the grievances of the attacker. This is not transnational victim-blaming cum hindsight. That Russians know of Chechen aims and the 2007 declaration of the Emirate has not muted President Putin’s resolve—vowing soon after the Volgograd attacks to “strongly and decisively continue the battle against terrorists until their total annihilation.” What it might mean, however, is a retraction of the public support (call it acquiescence) to stumble blindly into wars that only aggravate the conflict. Such a blissful state must be considered a new phenomenon on both sides of the ‘war on terror,’ for it was the second, Islamised Chechen War—the catastrophic siege of Grozny often likened to America’s own in Iraq’s Fallujah—that laid a firm basis for all subsequent attacks, including those in Volgograd and the ‘present’ promised Putin “for the Muslim blood that’s been spilled.” While the United States promised to stand “in solidarity with the Russian people against terrorism,” few Russians hold their breath. It was with disbelief that the Kremlin witnessed the toppling of Iraq’s Saddam Hussein, Libya’s Muammar Gaddafi, and now the attempt on Syria’s Bashar al-Assad—three regimes that “stood in opposition to all types of Islamic influence,” toppled in the American War on Terror. It is the fear of an Islamised Greater Middle East that drives Russian foreign policy in the region. Though Chechnya displays all signs of stability and recovery (a distinct difference to the recently recaptured Fallujah) there is little doubt the rise of such an entity would disturb the delicate equilibrium—the bombings in Volgograd are testament to the readiness of the militants, should such an entity arise. In some respects, when it comes to the ‘global war on terror,’ Russia feels hard-done-by, for the militants it fought in Afghanistan in the late 1980s—those who would follow the Soviet forces home—were, in part, trained by the United States. Just as the Soviet Union had (to a much smaller extent) armed the North Vietnamese against the Americans, the CIA provided training and arms (some of them state-of-the-art) to the Mujahedeen, in the words of National Security Advisor of the time, Zbigniew Brzezinski, to give “the USSR its Vietnam war.” That the repercussions of this would long outlast the Cold War was a hallmark of the blinkered strategies of the era. And though cooperation will always be difficult between two former enemies (indeed, some say a new Cold War’s already brewing), the classification of terrorist attacks on equal terms is a compulsory first step.

6,"China’s ADIZ: A Political Skirmish","2013-12-03 00:00:00","Matt Finucane",null,"China’s declaration of an Air Defence Identification Zone has prompted much debate around American strategy in the region, and how long-term interests must be served in light of the ambitions of this rising power. This has detracted somewhat from the edict itself—it’s dismissed as a fulfilment of our preconceptions of China (an expansionist power), and as just another part of a long-time trend. While valid to an extent, analysis of the ADIZ itself should not be left solely to prosaic reporters of run-of-the-mill news organisations. The ADIZ, fundamentally, was a political skirmish, a prod at the status quo to see how it would react. It intentionally engulfed the Japanese-administrated Senkaku/Diaoyu islands, knowing full well it would not further the acceptance of their claim to them. The choice of an ADIZ is also interesting, for they were first deployed by America as a countermeasure to further Japanese airborne attacks. As spokesman Yang Yujun responds in interview, though their ADIZ goes as far as 130 kilometres from Japanese territory, Japan themselves have operated an ADIZ since 1969 that too, is as near as 130 kilometres from Chinese territory; every detail of this arrangement is shrouded in precedents so as to detract from its fundamentally unilateral attempt to unhinge the status quo. Importantly, it was not an air exclusion zone, for that would demand reaction to any breach, arbitrary or not, or risk a dent in Chinese credibility. Such an arbitrary breach followed shortly after its declaration with the flight of two American B52 bombers through this airspace without prior warning. Indicative of the alliance system in the East China Sea, they were shortly followed by aircraft of Japan and South Korea. Both the act and the response were provocations, and like all provocations potentially dangerous, but what is important here are the relative positions and ambitions of China and America in the region. China, like all powers with such capabilities, seeks hegemony (and thus security) in its region, not presently afforded it by its encirclement by U.S.-friendly states. America, conversely, seeks a two-pronged strategy: to maintain the status quo for the sake of security, but not to alienate China (indeed, to further enmesh it in the global economy if possible) for the economic damage any split with China could wreak. It’s a difficult line to take, but any strategy negligent to either prong would soon fall short. While it may seem that American credibility too, was on the line, as Stephen Walt points out, U.S. credibility is more a problem for America’s allies than for itself. Nobody doubts a direct attack on American interests would solicit a direct response; what China was testing was America’s relationship with Japan. If China is set on breaking its encirclement it needs to start somewhere, and island disputes have been a time-honoured favourite. The efficacy of Obama’s ‘Pivot to Asia’ aside, a defensive strategy such as this—its visibility dependent on Chinese initiatives—can lead to questions of whether any strategy exists at all; military presence alone does not count. However, no such textbook exists, asides from a propensity to meet provocation with limited (the B52s were unarmed) and transparent escalation. The astute use of such action has declared null China’s ADIZ, and though the Senkaku/Diaoyu issue is far from resolved, the status quo remains much as it was before. America will not allow China to make unilateral changes in its favour, and though tensions between China and Japan are as fraught as ever, so long as America agrees to hold the reigns, the likelihood of serious confrontation remains slim.

7,"Kennedy’s Legacy and the Danger of Whatif History","2013-11-21 00:00:00","Matt Finucane",null,"More so than most figures in U.S. history, the 50th anniversary of President Kennedy’s assassination will evoke much soul-searching not just in America but around the world. Those old enough to recall his tenure will reminisce about opportunities lost, but for all to see, the spectre of youth and modernity Kennedy embodied will be revived. Amidst this harmless commemoration will nevertheless arise the whatif history of how different the world might be had he survived. Such history is, often self-consciously, raw speculation formulated to feed innocent recreation. However, eager hobbyists that paint so rosy a picture of Kennedy’s administration should be met with scepticism. While Americans at the time would enjoy greater civil liberties and a newfound hope in the future, the international primacy that afforded such dreams never wavered. Kennedy, though opposed to all-out war, defended this primacy just as stalwartly as any who succeeded him, and by more or less as unsavoury means. His presidency is best remembered for the Cuban Missile Crisis in which—though his agency was limited—total nuclear war was risked over events that hardly altered the strategic balance. This is, to some extent, allowed to overshadow The Bay of Pigs invasion, whereby shadily US-trained paramilitaries were landed in Cuba to overthrow Prime Minister Fidel Castro. While the invasion failed, the legacy was long-lasting in two senses: secretive operations would form the mainstay of Kennedy’s foreign policy, and thus his overt successes would consistently overshadow his covert failings. The epitome of this policy was in Vietnam, a war often accredited to his successors for their roles in the escalation that swiftly followed Kennedy’s demise. It must be remembered, however, that it was Kennedy’s escalation that set the trap which would ensnare a further two presidencies. The irreconcilability of ‘losing’ Vietnam, and winning the next U.S. election paired in Kennedy’s mind as much as in Johnson’s and Nixon’s. It is arguable that the failure of Kennedy’s special operations made escalation—in a desperate bid to ‘win’—the only option for his successors. On his record stands the insertion of Special Forces (tasked with destabilising North Vietnam) long before war was declared; the adoption of the Strategic Hamlet programme of forced relocation, a time-honoured strategy of imperial control; initiating the widespread defoliation of Vietnam; and standing idly by (though some say endorsing, for it was certainly in U.S. interests) while the South’s President Diem was brutally overthrown. Kennedy opposed all-out war, as Just War theory dictates, until it was the final option and diplomacy had been exhausted. However, he presided over a campaign of heinously violent covert operations long before they were the final option and rarely conducive to accomplishing America’s erstwhile objectives. Indeed, certain parallels can be drawn here with today’s administration. When the country had grown war-weary under Nixon, a return of emphasis was made to covert operations that involved limited ‘boots on the ground,’ and risked minimal accountability. With increasing numbers of troops withdrawing from the Middle East, drone operations have greatly escalated, and like Nixon’s, their efficacy—especially when destabilising peace talks with Pakistan—can certainly be called into question. Adherents to the Kennedy dream often paint him as a lone protagonist fighting off the advances of his hawkish advisers, but the only effect this has, in light of his record, is to diminish the perceived power of the president—hardly the harbinger of a new, peaceful world. So amidst the reminiscence and hagiography that will no doubt follow tomorrow’s anniversary, take note that America’s position in the world slipped not a notch, nor could it have been expected to. Kennedy’s ‘gentle giant’ was only as gentle as any hegemon’s, its primus inter pares status never doubted. He may have sought a brighter future, but these things are predicated on the international system he showed little concerted effort to change; America’s dominance went without saying, and the means by which it would be maintained were almost without limit.

8,"Vladimir Putin: An Unlikely Nobel Laureate","2013-10-24 00:00:00","Matt Finucane",null,"Following the seemingly emerging trend of bestowing prestigious international awards to unlikely and contentious candidates, this year’s Nobel Peace prize will go to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Praised for “its extensive efforts to eliminate chemical weapons,” and in light of recent transgressions in Syria, this appears at first a symbolic appreciation for their thankless task that lies ahead amidst the civil war. Why then, was there such uproar from Russians, and others, alike? Why was it labelled by the journalist and historian, William Engdahl, a “political dodge?” They insist that the only valid recipients, if the award is to praise the resolution of Syria’s international crisis, are Vladimir Putin and his Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov. Clearly this is a controversy in itself, for beyond the realms of Pravda, nobody disputes that Putin is no angel. Being almost the sole provider for the Assad regime, the recent memories of his wars in Georgia, and before that, Chechnya, afford him the scorn of diplomats and journalists, while his endorsement of homophobic legislation and suppression of dissidents attract more international reproach. Indeed, it can be said that in inheriting as unpopular, and unwinnable war as Chechnya he and his Nobel-winning counterpart, Obama, are quite alike. However, in Syria it is a stark fact that while the US was gearing up for intervention (with France in tow, apparently only “hours” from striking), Putin’s intercedence is the solitary reason that the missiles remained in their silos. By rewarding those who were sent at Putin’s behest the Nobel Committee has, perhaps intentionally, unearthed something. The Western world is not ready for the hypocrisy of Putin, the Nobel laureate; be that for his record, or for his non-Western politics. For him to be deemed ‘beyond the pale’ when considering the European Union’s 2012 award (amidst the present social and economic turmoil), and Obama’s 2009 award, after only nine months in office (and something of a mixed record in his pursuit of peace), is only made more remarkable. Whether history books will duly accredit Putin with disarming the Syrian crisis will remain to be seen; the more immediate concern is, with awards like these, how long the Nobel Committee can guarantee its standing as a credible, truly international institution.

9,"Obama and Rouhani: Cordial Relations Are Still a Long Way Off","2013-10-05 00:00:00","Matt Finucane",null,"History was apparently made when Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, received a phone call from Barack Obama at the United Nations assembly last month. It marked the first time in 27 years that senior leaders of each government had talked directly, and—besides exchanging the usual sycophantic pleasantries—they reportedly discussed their mutual desire to rapidly resolve the “nuclear issue” that has divided them for so long. Some quickly lauded this as the first sign of an American/Iranian rapprochement, however, to those well versed in the history of these two states it is clear that there remain some major challenges before cordial relations can really be back on the table. Fundamentally, any agreement with Iran must include substantial (or total) relaxation of the sanctions enacted by the US and the European Union. Secondly, Iran will not accept any offer that forfeits its inalienable right to the peaceful use of nuclear technology. While there has been some suggestion of eventual reductions in sanctions, in many sectors of the US policy machine Iran’s retention of nuclear technology is unthinkable. Indeed, these hardliners follow a path lain by Israeli president, Benjamin Netanyahu—a keen advocate of pre-emptive strikes and regime change in Tehran. This is not to say there are not hardliners on the Iranian side. Rouhani’s car was pelted with eggs and shoes by protestors incensed that he would entertain talks with “the Great Satan,” America. Indeed, chants of “death to America” are not uncommon, but it must be remembered that Iran’s people suffer terribly by the international sanctions—just as Iraq’s people before them. They have led to great deficits in medicine and standard of living, and this serves only to further embitter the populace. To those who ask why Iran won’t just roll over and die, the answer is clear. Imagining for a moment that such hawkish ambitions did not exist among the higher echelons of the US government, Iranians have already had two clear examples of states that surrendered their nuclear programmes: Iraq and Libya. They too have a partner in nuclear ambition—one far more dangerous than Iraq ever was—whose regime nonetheless lives and breathes today: North Korea. Of Iraq and Libya’s leaders, the first was hanged in a military base and the second shot in a ditch. Neither would have perished without American backing, and the possession of a nuclear arsenal (or at least the capability to develop one) has proven to be the only dependable guarantee against such transgressions. Whether progress in their relationship can be made will be almost entirely determined by the flexibility of Obama’s diplomacy. Intransigence will only beget frustration and escalation; America would be wise to avoid yet another conflict in the Middle East. This article was originally published by Concrete.

10,"Free Press Under Threat?: The State of UK Journalism","2014-02-25 00:00:00",Mike.R,null,"From Edward Snowden’s NSA leaks to the phone hacking scandal, journalists are increasingly making the news. While the UK government’s response to the allegations of phone hacking, a judge-led inquiry, was measured, its reaction to the revelations brought forth by Edward Snowden has been thinly veiled panic. And the result is worrying. Under pressure from the government to turn over the hard drives containing NSA files, staff at the Guardian newspaper elected to destroy them in July 2013, knowing full well they had copies overseas. This prevented the data from being seized by the British government but allowed reporting to continue. However, the following month it was made clear that this was not the end of it. David Miranda, partner of Snowden-leak Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald, was detained at Heathrow airport on his way home from Brazil and interrogated for nearly nine hours. The authorities confiscated a computer, two flash drives and other technology that was in his possession and questioned him about Greenwald and Snowden, among other topics. Heavy-handed doesn’t even cut it. This is clearly authoritarian treatment of a person carrying information for the press using the Terrorism Act as an excuse. What now? MPs are currently discussing Minister of State Oliver Letwin’s Deregulation Bill. Ostensibly intended to streamline services and cut out bureaucracy, the bill contains a clause that would change the way authorities gain access to journalists’ notes and files. Under the current system a court order must be obtained after a hearing where representatives from both the government and the press are present. The Deregulation Bill would allow warrants to be gained from secret courts to which newspapers would not be permitted to send lawyers. Sound exactly like how a free press is supposed to operate? No? The so-called Fourth Estate is certainly under threat. And with the controversial issue of press regulation after the phone hacking inquiry still on the table, the skies look ominous. What was meant to be a strategy to secure people’s privacy could so easily turn into a way to open up the press to government pressure in the name of ‘national security’. This sounds like US rhetoric, but it could become a reality here in the UK too. The NSA leaks have hurt the UK. GCHQ, the UK’s intelligence service, has been widely implicated by information provided by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden and published by the Guardian and other leading international newspapers. Recent reports, for instance, assert that GCHQ and the NSA used Angry Birds and other mobile apps to obtain personal data, and that GCHQ used online viruses to discredit individuals. The government isn’t sure how to react. They don’t like what’s happening but know that the British right for the press to operate freely is enshrined in law. The Guardian reported that Cabinet Secretary Jeremy Heywood, sent to persuade the paper to hand over their data, said: “We can do this nicely or we can go to law”. The next quotation was even more chilling: “A lot of people in government think you should be closed down.” Closed. Down. The traditional liberty of the free press is under threat. Whether under the guise of ‘cutting out bureaucracy’, ensuring ‘national security’ or something else entirely, it is clear that the press is at risk of further government pressure. It remains to be seen if Oliver Letwin’s secret courts bill will be passed; it’s currently been pulled aside to allow for consultation with the Newspapers Society. Whatever happens, it is unlikely that we have seen the end of attempts to infringe upon the way newspapers protect their information. This will be especially true as long as Edward Snowden remains free of the US authorities and his information is being revealed to the public by brave newspapers.

11,"The UN and Iran: Friend or Foe? Keep Them Close…","2014-01-29 00:00:00",Mike.R,null,"By withdrawing its invitation to Iran to join the Syria peace talks, the UN has missed a golden opportunity that carried very little actual risk. After initially inviting Iranian delegates to the Geneva II Conference the UN rescinded its invitation after angry responses from the US and the Syrian National Coalition (SNC). Iran supports the current regime, including President Bashar al-Assad, but that doesn’t mean that the UN was right to uninvite them. Let’s set aside the idea that all sides of an argument should be heard and that all relevant parties should in reality be present at an international conference. This doesn’t happen in practice. The West’s anger at the invitation to Iran is actually very short-sighted. Sure they don’t agree on what should happen to Assad, but this is just one issue. The larger effect would have been, and still can be, positive. Look at Iran’s situation. They’ve just reached an interim deal on their nuclear energy programme with the UN Security Council and Germany (P5+1). In return they received a lessening of economic sanctions to the tune of $4.2bn in oil revenue. The P5+1 were very clear, however, that this relief is reversible if Iran fails to keep up with its end of the bargain. This being said, it’s not a giant leap to suggest that if Iran makes a nuisance of itself on the world stage (or rather, annoys the West by backing Assad too far) further reprieves from economic measures might be slow, limited, or non-existent. With this in mind it’s safe to assume that had Iran been present at Geneva II its representatives would probably have been instructed by President Rouhani to maintain their support for the Syrian government but to be very careful in doing so. Iran would have felt better for the measure of trust the West put in them, and the West would have profited by tempering one of Assad’s staunchest allies. The potential doesn’t stop there, however. If Iran is engaged on an international diplomatic level, providing that Rouhani’s moderate administration are left alone by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, then the result could be a diplomatic masterstroke in the eyes of the US and others. While much of this can be construed as blue-sky-thinking, which of course it is, there is a logic to it. Iran has the potential to revive its former status as a major regional, and indeed global presence. It certainly won’t be a return to the cordial relations of the mid-twentieth century it enjoyed with Israel, but a more internationally involved Iran would benefit all parties. For Iran it might mean a quicker return to economic stability, and for the West the opportunity to raise other issues, for example Iranian assistance and training of militia for the Syrian government, and relations with Lebanese Hezbollah. The Geneva II talks finished yesterday (28th January) and Iran was not there, but there will be many more conferences before there is calm in Syria. The UN might want to reconsider whether it wants Iran left out of those as well.

12,"Foreign Aid: How the West Funds Terrorism","2013-12-12 00:00:00",Mike.R,null,"This week the US and UK announced the suspension of ‘non-lethal’ aid to Syria. This is because the Western-backed Free Syrian Army (FSA) is being increasingly eclipsed by Islamist rebels, some of whom recently united to form a 45,000 strong force. Humanitarian aid will continue to enter Syria through non-governmental organisations and charities, but direct aid is to cease due to concerns about who would receive it. This, however, isn’t a new problem. Nor is the removal of assistance entirely because of events in Syria. Islamism in Syria merely serves to highlight a problem the US, the UK, and others have faced for years: not all pledged funding reaches the desired recipient. Corruption, bureaucracy and ‘enemies’ often get in the way. Let’s start with Syria. There’s a simple reason why the West has not, on a large scale at least, armed the rebels: Libya. Arms supplied to the Libyan rebels fighting Moammar Gaddafi found their way across the border into neighbouring conflicts. Western weapons were used against French forces in Mali, and members of Islamist groups wield them in Syria. The US rhetoric on Syria has always been in terms of red lines and controlled airstrikes: more expensive but less risky to US personnel elsewhere. Any intervention would utilise the same ‘no boots-on-the-ground’ policy (with the exception of covert black-ops teams) that was used in Libya. Governmental infrastructure in Afghanistan is inconsistent and rife with corruption. Pre-invasion warlords still hold sway in society and improvements are slow to take effect. As of June 2013 the total bill for US aid to Afghanistan is $96.57bn and in 2011 alone the US sent $12.9bn. However, in a recent report, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) criticised the supervision of foreign aid. SIGAR aims to ‘provide independent and objective oversight of Afghanistan reconstruction projects and activities’ and provides quarterly reports on the use of foreign aid funds. In its latest report the Inspector General said that it cannot assure the DOD that ‘the funds provided directly to the Afghan government to fund and equip the ANSF are sufficiently protected and used as intended.’ This is a stinging criticism of both the US financial assistance delivery system and corruption in the Afghan bureaucracy. Also in the news this week, international aid agencies are having to pay money to Somali terrorist group al-Shabab in order to deliver humanitarian support to people living in areas they control. This was especially prevalent during the 2011 famine. A report from the Humanitarian Policy Group (HPG) found that al-Shabab often demanded ‘registration fees’ that ranged between $500 and $10,000 depending on the region and the nature of the proposed project. After an agreement was reached additional taxes were sometimes charged. Some NGOs were able to avoid paying fees after they ‘allocated significant resources and time to understanding the group, developing relationships and pursuing dialogue.’ Finally, a report from a group called Development Initiatives based in Bristol, UK featured in the Guardian estimated that at least 20% of funds earmarked for foreign aid never leave the donor country. According to the study, $22bn of over $100bn pledged assistance in 2011 never reached the countries it was intended for. Clearly there is a discrepancy between what is promised and what is delivered. What to conclude from this? Giving money to developing countries is not nearly as simple as allocating the funds. In the simplest cases money is often diverted or siphoned off due to corrupt officials, in other circumstances agencies are faced with a choice between funding terrorism and abandoning people who need help. The withdrawal of assistance for the Syrian rebels is a sign that the US and UK governments are beginning to realise the pitfalls of sending aid to war torn countries. Clearly more must to be done to ensure that money goes to the people who need it. CC Image Courtesy of NATO Training Mission-Afghanistan, Flickr.

13,"Afghanistan: Effective US Withdrawal is Impossible","2013-11-24 00:00:00",Mike.R,null,"Talks among Afghan tribal elders are ongoing at the Loya Jirga this week over the prospect of the withdrawal of American troops in 2014. The outgoing President of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai, has requested that any agreement should be signed after the presidential elections in April next year, however it is likely that a deal will be reached before the end of 2013. The current lay of the land is that 15,000 US soldiers will remain in Afghanistan after the withdrawal. Their brief will largely be confined to training the Afghan military, but the door has been left open for them to carry out “counter-terror operations”. A typical almost-withdrawal then. The Cold War may have ended (that’s a different argument) but the US does like to leave small pockets of soldiers all over the place. But what of the concept of NATO leaving Afghanistan? What the international community wants is to leave a stable and secure country that can solve remaining problems without the assistance of foreign militaries. However, is this really possible? When the time for the bulk of US troops to leave finally arrives next year the White House will attempt to assure the public that the infrastructure they leave behind is enough to set the country on course for a promising future. The reality, on the other hand, is that Afghanistan will be left facing a multitude of problems, many of which predate the war. Corruption is rife in Afghanistan. The war-ravaged nation ranked joint last with Somalia and North Korea in Transparency International’s 2012 index. Allegations of corrupt activity plague both the military and the fledgling bureaucracy. This raises both the question of whether the central authority in Kabul can effectively rule over regions where pre-invasion warlords still hold sway, and of how effectively any future foreign aid would be put to use. A good parallel is Libya, where the new government in Tripoli is up against the influence of militia in the capital and powerful tribes in the south where its control is limited. Another problem is that, even now with the US about to withdraw its troops, the mountain regions along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border are lawless strongholds of the Taliban. When you add accusations of the ISI (Pakistan’s intelligence service), and possibly even the Pakistani government, turning a blind eye to (or at worst, directly assisting) the Taliban to the mix, the resulting stew is dangerous. How can the international community hope for Afghanistan to fix itself when insurgents that the American military failed to root out still occupy the county’s border? Parallels can be seen with guerrilla fighters in Vietnam. Negotiations with the Taliban are ongoing, with a Taliban embassy set up in Doha, Qatar. This process has barely begun, however. It could be argued that maintaining the American army in Afghanistan would force the negotiations to speed up, and that a withdrawal might cause the Taliban to feel more secure in their position and toughen and expand their demands. Whatever happens, US pressure inevitably will be needed for the talks to go anywhere at all. Another job to be crammed into John Kerry’s already packed schedule. Safe in the knowledge that he doesn’t need to win any more elections, Hamid Karzai has taken the opportunity to criticise American military actions in Afghanistan, particularly its drone policy. While this is a fair argument (and this is not a defence of the drone programme), his criticism is probably unhelpful in that the country needs American assistance in the long run. Without major foreign investment the country will undoubtedly fail, and none will match the sums America will put forward. Regardless of whether or not withdrawal in 2014 is a good idea for the enduring stability of Afghanistan, there is no alternative now. President Obama cannot delay the departure of the vast majority of American troops; to do so would be suicide for the Democratic Party in 2016. He cannot afford another public backlash such as the one that followed Snowdengate. US troops will leave in 2014, what remains to be seen is whether the country will survive.

14,"Iran and Israel: Nuclear Energy in the Shadows","2013-10-07 00:00:00",Mike.R,null,"Iran is currently crippled by international sanctions as a result of the west’s distrust of its nuclear programme. Many believe it is trying to reach a stage where it could quickly acquire a nuclear weapon. This is something the Iranian government has strongly denied. During the tenure of former-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad tensions escalated to the point where Israel threatened unilateral strikes against Iran’s nuclear facilities. The election of President Hassan Rouhani has prompted many to predict a greater transparency on the Iranian side and a relaxation of economic sanctions. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not among them, however. According to Netanyahu, “As dangerous as a nuclear-armed North Korea is, it pales in comparison to the danger of a nuclear-armed Iran”. Indeed he said: “A nuclear-armed Iran in the Middle East wouldn’t be another North Korea — it would be another 50 North Koreas.” (Source: AFP) The Israeli leader is keen to discourage any rapprochement between Iran and the US; but the more transparent Iran becomes about its nuclear development, the more likely this could be. This is, however, not the real reason Israel doesn’t want Iran to become more transparent. There are two main reasons Netanyahu doesn’t want Rouhani to talk. Firstly, if Iran wants to successfully re-integrate with the international community it may well have to commit willingly to never develop a nuclear weapon, and be open to inspections by the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) to prove its honesty. This eventuality, then, would see Iran decide not to build an atomic weapon. Israel would rather Iran was rendered incapable of developing one. This would maintain the existing regional power balance whereby Israel, like in the Six-Day War of 1967, could single-handedly defeat all her neighbours in battle at the same time. Global Firepower ranks Israel at #13 in the world for military strength, and the most powerful in the Middle East. This index does not include nuclear weapons. This leads nicely into the other reason Israel doesn’t want Iran spilling the beans on its nuclear programme. If Iran were to become entirely honest about its nuclear research and promise (with evidence to support) to never develop a nuclear weapon, it would naturally be justifiable for it to ask for the same clarity from other nations. Israel is widely reported to possess approximately 80 nuclear warheads, but has never admitted it. Israel will want to keep the spotlight of the world’s media away from its nuclear arsenal, especially with the flak it received over ‘Prisoner X’ still fresh in its memory. How will it do this? It will continue to label Iran a dangerous state and Rouhani a fake in an attempt to stop Iran from gaining ground on the international stage.

15,"Syria: A Poker Game","2013-09-29 00:00:00",Mike.R,null,"The UN has adopted a resolution to securely dispose of Syria’s chemical weapons after Russia and the US reached an apparent agreement. This has been hailed as a victory for international diplomacy. It isn’t. It is merely just another move in the poker game that is Syria, or rather, the Middle East. At first glance it does appear that the initiative presented by Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s Foreign Minister, for the international community to supervise the disposal of Syria’s chemical weapons stores is just that. However, it is also a deeper counterstroke against America. This becomes clearer once we consider the various sides of the conflict. On ground level the rebels, made up of various groups of which only some work together, are fighting the forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad (this is obviously a very simplified perspective but serves to illustrate the point). On the global stage Assad’s allies are Iran, crippled by international sanctions, and Russia. America and much of the west support the rebels. It is clear from the aggressive line America is taking that it wants to intervene militarily. This can be seen in its constant threats, as well as its history of involvement in the region. A stable, pro-western Middle East, is America’s ideal status quo- just look at their friendship with Saudi Arabia. Russia, on the other hand is doing everything it can to prevent the US from direct action. So when America adopted chemical weapons use as its latest basis for intervention, Russia called its bluff. Amid the ensuing diplomacy America has looked entirely committed to the plan to dispose of Syria’s chemical weapons, and it would be foolish to argue that it isn’t. America wants the humanitarian crisis in Syria to end, it just disagrees with Russia on how to do it. Don’t be surprised when, in a few weeks or months, another factor arises that demands military involvement. It would be too far to say that the Cold War never ended, but neither side has forgotten the rules of the game. CC image courtesy of DFID, Flickr.

16,"Military in Politics: Some Things Never Change","2013-07-01 00:00:00",Mike.R,null,"The Egyptian army has threatened to intervene if the present unrest is allowed to continue. The military has given political parties 48 hours to open a dialogue with the protesters that are filling the streets of Cairo day after day, calling upon Mohammed Morsi to resign. Today the Cairo headquarters of Morsi’s political party, The Muslim Brotherhood, were ransacked- an incident in which 8 people were killed. In response to the continuing unrest the Egyptian army issued an ultimatum: they would intervene and “announce a road map for the future” if the government did not address the people’s concerns. “The Armed Forces repeat their call for the people’s demands to be met and give everyone 48 hours as a last chance to shoulder the burden of the historic moment that is happening in the nation”. The meaning of this is clear, if the political parties do not resolve the situation then the army will resolve it for them. So, by responding to the demands of the people, the army are supporting democracy, right? Not necessarily. Indeed any intervention by military personnel in mainstream politics has shaky democratic justification at best. On top of this the motives behind such an intervention are unclear. In its ultimatum the army professes its commitment to the Egyptian people and to democracy. The last time the army were in charge, immediately after the resignation of Hosni Mubarak, there was controversy over their commitment to the transition and accusations that changes were not being implemented as quickly as they could have been. The involvement of the armed forces in Middle East politics is nothing new. As colonial rule came to an end the various newly-independent states had to fend for themselves. The widespread lack of solid political institutions meant that these new countries were often unstable and relied on their military forces to ensure peace. The 20th century in the Middle East was marked by hundreds of military coups, some successful and others not. The regimes that arose from these takeovers were often just as unstable as those they overthrew. Pre-Saddam Hussein era Iraq is a good example, which experienced multiple coups in the 1950s and ’60s. The resulting regimes resorted to repression by military force in order to maintain control. So what does this mean for modern-day Egypt? The army is unlikely to go so far as to seize power in a coup d’état, but any intervention will still be significant. Morsi looks unlikely to resign. It will be interesting, then, to see how he treats the armed forces after this challenge. Will he take a similarly ruthless attitude to how he dealt with the judiciary? Will he implement a purge? Whatever happens, the protests in the streets of Cairo and the army’s ultimatum reveal an age-old weakness that still permeates Middle Eastern politics today: the military still see a role for themselves in government. They still have an influence over the running of the state and are unwilling to give that influence up.

So why are the Americans arming the rebels? Firstly it seems important to point out that this is nothing new. Croatian-made weapons, paid for by Saudi Arabia, have already been seen in the hands of the opposition. It is unlikely that this action was not in some way sanctioned or approved by the US. However, the decision to arm the rebels directly is significant, and marks a shift from observation and non-lethal assistance to active involvement in the conflict. The motives for this decision, besides the apparent use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government, are worth exploring (especially since some evidence points to rebel use of chemical agents as well). The US, as part of NATO, assisted the Libyan rebels fighting Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, and there are obviously parallels between this and the current situation in Syria. Both conflicts were sparked by the Arab Spring and involved armed groups seeking to overthrow their governments by violent means. However, there are probably more differences than similarities. The Libyan opposition were able to present something akin to a united front against the loyalist forces, and were able to coordinate their military campaign. The Syrian opposition on the ground are made up of various groups who are essentially all fighting the same enemy separately. Chris Philips, Lecturer in International Relations at Queen Mary and former member of the Economist Intelligence Unit, described the rebels’ situation:“They loosely have the same goal, which is that they want to topple [President Bashar al-] Assad… However, most militias … are local groups, they formed locally and have local concerns, and whilst they’ve been able to coordinate some attacks there’s also been a lot of difficulties in keeping them united with the same immediate aims”. It is also uncertain how much control the Syrian National Coalition, the political organisation incorporating various rebel groups, has over the actual forces fighting on the ground. Some groups fighting Bashar al-Assad do not fight for the SNC. As well as not necessarily having the same aims as each other, the rebels do not necessarily envisage the same outcome in the event of their victory as does the US and the West. The West appears to hope that if the rebels won a moderate, pro-western, government would be established. This is, however, unlikely. As has been seen in Egypt, it is more likely to be a radical government that eventually arises from the current chaos. Many groups are deeply Islamist, and the Al-Nusra Front has declared its allegiance to Al-Qaeda. It will be a difficult task for the US to ensure that its weapons reach the right hands. The Obama administration will be seeking to distract the US public, and indeed the world, from recent revelations regarding the NSA surveillance operation (codenamed Prism). It will also want to pacify Israel, whose government is growing increasingly unsettled with ongoing events in the region. It may be that intervention in Syria will provide a distraction from domestic issues, but the action may yield very little, and risk destabilising the region further. The UK’s position on the matter is still uncertain. Prime Minister David Cameron confirmed that the UK has “made no decision to arm the opposition, but it was right to lift the arms embargo”. While he confirmed that “there is credible evidence of multiple attacks using chemical weapons in Syria, including the use of the abhorrent agent Sarin” he would not be drawn on the UK’s future position. However it is likely that, if the US proceeds with arming the Syrian opposition, whether or not this sanctioned by the UN, the UK may follow suit. The situation is volatile and changes day by day. With a death toll now topping 90,000 the West does not want to stand idly by, but it may well be that the US has misjudged the situation. Syria is not just another Arab Spring revolution; it is a brutal and bloody civil war. CC Image Courtesy of Christiaan Triebert, Flickr Enjoyed it?

18,"The EU Vote Cameron Doesn’t Want","2013-02-07 00:00:00",Mike.R,null,"Prime Minister David Cameron has promised the British public an in/out referendum on the UK’s membership of the European Union (EU). The referendum itself will give voters a choice of staying in the EU, with more powers retained by Westminster, or leaving the union. Cameron had previously rejected calls from within his own party for such a renegotiation of Britain’s international position. Indeed, during a session of Prime Minister’s Questions in March 2011, Cameron refused to promise a referendum, saying: “I think that we are better off inside the EU but making changes to it.” Why the sudden change of course? Surely, as Prime Minister and leader of the Conservative Party, he has the final say on Conservative policy? The recent rise of the UK Independence Party (UKIP), seen in the Corby by-election where they placed third, above the Liberal Democrats, is a significant factor in the new Tory party direction. UKIP have long been regarded by many as a single policy party, something which has hampered their efforts to win seats in Parliament. The question is what happens to them now that the Conservatives are set to deliver what UKIP voters have called for? In some ways Cameron has made a shrewd decision, by seeking a referendum he has essentially robbed UKIP of their main source of popularity and made an effort to stem any loss of voters from his party to Nigel Farage’s. However, this move may not work. Instead of neutering them, Cameron’s referendum pledge may only serve to legitimise UKIP in the eyes of the public, who will see that the party’s age old question has finally been answered. The Prime Minister is playing with fire. It is obvious that any increase in UKIP votes will hit the Tories harder than any other party. UKIP are not the only problem for the Prime Minister. Indeed he faces a potential fifth column of Eurosceptic backbench MPs. In late 2011 81 Tory MPs defied the Prime Minister and voted for a referendum on Britain’s EU membership. The motion was defeated, but cracks in the party were clear. This then may be the real reason behind the promised referendum- keeping the Conservative party in one piece. It is unlikely that Cameron’s views on Europe have changed so profoundly in so little time. The Prime Minister knows his party faces an uphill struggle in the next election, and a divided party will only make that task harder. If the current situation doesn’t change, 2015 is going to be a rough time for the Tories. A YouGov/The Sun poll gave the Conservatives a 32% share of a hypothetical vote, while Labour took 42%. Interestingly the Lib Dems and UKIP were neck and neck on 11% and 8% respectively. Cameron has every reason to be afraid. What does all this say about the coalition? Both parties have had to compromise since May 2010, the Liberal Democrats arguably more so than the Conservatives. Issues such as tuition fees, AV, House of Lords reform, and boundary changes have already seen the coalition divided, and any referendum on Britain’s position in Europe will be no different. Coupled with the wild swings in policy, of which Cameron’s mixed signals over Europe are a typical example, this does not inspire confidence in the coalition or create an image of a stable government. The Prime Minister is appearing more and more desperate to keep his government together amid poor economic recovery and the rise of Ed Miliband. This referendum is an exercise in party control.

19,"Kasparov Arrest: Not the Right Move","2012-08-25 00:00:00",Mike.R,null,"Russia has come to the forefront of the news in recent weeks with the arrest and conviction of members of the punk band Pussy Riot. They were convicted of hooliganism motivated by religious hatred after protesting inside a Moscow cathedral. The media storm and worldwide condemnation this provoked was astonishing, especially for such a little-known group. Also arrested at the protests was former World Chess Champion, Garry Kasparov. Since his retirement from professional chess, Kasparov has been at the centre of the protests. He leads the United Civil Front movement, and was a contender for President in the last election. He was arrested at a protest whilst talking to a journalist, and taken for questioning. He has since been released. Kasparov said that: “I think it’s a very important day, a historical day, because for the first time in our courts, the evidence of a policeman was not accepted just because he wears a uniform”. However, when in the context of the Pussy Riot public relations fiasco, is this really what happened? Looking at the facts it seems more likely that the Kremlin did not want another round of international condemnation. Furthermore it might well be the case that sending him to prison might have deeper consequences than the Pussy Riot case. Kasparov’s worldwide fame and respect for his career in chess, coupled with his prominent position in protest politics, might provoke real action. While the UN will be wanting to stay clear of the situation for as long as possible, Kasparov’s followers might step up their protests, thus prolonging the government’s irritation. Kasparov was accused of biting the finger of one of the policemen who arrested him. It is still possible that this could lead to a criminal investigation. It should be kept in mind that, although thousands march the streets in protest, Russia is in no way another ‘Arab Spring’ revolution-in-waiting (beyond the obvious that it isn’t in the Middle East). President Putin is currently trying to cement himself in power again, and will continue his pattern of bringing in regulations that hark back to Soviet-era politics. It is clear that he is willing to use force to achieve this. The increasing tension between Russia and the West may create more obstacles on issues like Iran’s nuclear program, where Russia (and in this case China) already disagree with the other three permanent members of the UN Security Council (UK, US, and France).

20,"Syria’s an International Game, but Britain’s no longer an International Player","2013-09-25 00:00:00","Matt Finucane",null,"In the wake of what George Galloway has called the “democratic revolt” against the government it seems increasingly unlikely that Britain will participate in military strikes against Syria. Worth exploring, however, is why the government was so desperate to intervene, what were their stated motives, and what impact parliament’s decision might have on Britain’s status in the world. It must be understood that Syria is an international war. Simplified, the West supports the rebels, Russia supports the regime, and both have essentially been fighting each other by means of arms exports and funding since the war began. However, in light of a changing trend on the battlefield (the once-successful rebels are now losing) any reason for the West to ramp up its involvement must be viewed cynically. The establishment of a “red line” on the use of chemical weapons (a line which had been crossed many times already, as most sources agree) is such a reason, and forms the basis for Cameron’s incitement to war. Evidence for Assad’s culpability in the attack is vague and hard to come by, and there too are counterclaims, backed by the regime, that blame the rebels for carrying out the attack in a desperate bid to draw the US in. However, the desire to punish a regime likely guilty of such atrocities does not justify the desperation to intervene witnessed in Britain, France, and the USA. As many have pointed out, similar atrocities have occurred elsewhere and met no sanction; there are other factors at play in Syria. Fundamentally the United States would like to see Russia embarrassed. They would like to prove, once again, that Russia is not its ancestral Superpower, the USSR, and that its capabilities are limited. This falls broadly under the matter of “credibility,” and is something for the US to be concerned about. The application of this concept to Britain, however, is either farcical, wilfully naïve, or both. It should not be surprising that the two permanent members of the UN Security Council least deserving of their permanency (Britain and France) have been those calling loudest for war. Regardless of whether Britain intervenes, its “credibility” would remain much the same as it was before: that of a “middle power” no longer worthy of Great Power status. UK involvement alongside the US would inevitably reflect this, and in this sense alone, Syrian intervention might evoke memories of the Cold War. War in Syria would have been a disaster for everyone involved, and is no longer a game the UK should be playing. Instead it appears that Britain will pioneer the only effort that sees Syrians themselves centre-stage—in place of credibility or power balances—by donating an additional £52 million to help tackle the humanitarian crisis this war has spawned. For this, Britain should be commended, but lest it be forgotten that those most naïve in today’s government would sooner send missiles than medicines.

21,"Intervention in Syria: The Next Move, and a Game-Changer","2013-09-06 00:00:00","Matt Finucane",null,"The war in Syria has always been a conflict fought in the shadows of international powers. The blood spilt has been tremendous, and only made worse by the recent spate of chemical attacks targeting civilians. Global intervention has already been rife, however, it is this latest use of chemical weapons that has prompted the threat of direct intervention, a course of action for which the repercussions will be great. Intervention thus far has depended entirely on either side’s interests in Syria’s future. Russia, Syria’s staunches ally in this affair, seeks to uphold the status quo: a pro-Russian government, complete with substantial arms sales, and security of Russia’s only Mediterranean naval base as well as their gas interests in the area. To achieve these ends, all that has been required is the continuous flow of high-grade weapons to the Assad regime. The West’s intentions, until recently, have been less clear. Their coalition of ex-imperial powers and regional cronies has until now defied all satire in their insistence that direct intervention seeks only to “punish and deter.” However, recent statements of overt support for the opposition make it clear that regime change in the Middle East is once again their primary goal. Why this has changed so recently is quite clear. At the onset of the war, much like in Libya, it appeared the rebels would win a swift victory, their predestined track lightly oiled by small-scale arming of their forces by the West. In the past year, however, the Assad regime’s resilience has become evident, and in the past months the opposition has suffered a series of defeats and has lost a great deal of ground; it was looking likely that the regime might win. A victory such as this would be great news for Russia. Beyond the specific significance that Syria holds for Russia it would serve as proof that not only will they stand up to Western provocation in its “near abroad,” but also in more distant theatres. That the US will allow such a victory is now unlikely, having officially declared the desire to see Assad overthrown. The question of what they can actually do about this, however, is difficult to answer. The matter of how to intervene, and for how long will determine the outcome of the Syrian civil war. It is clear the US has the force to overthrow Assad, to dispose of his chemical weapons, and to lead the rebels to victory; what they lack is not to be underestimated, for it has already vetoed British military involvement: the good will of the demos. At present, the Senate’s Foreign Relations Committee has approved a resolution that allows for 90 days of a “limited military mission” in Syria. The most popular means, presently, is missile bombardment, although exactly how this will achieve their objectives is questionable. With “boots on the ground” explicitly outlawed, it seems highly unlikely that the US will be able to sufficiently degrade Assad’s chemical weapons capabilities. Now more likely is the targeting of key military establishments and infrastructure—those facilities the rebels have least of, and least defence from—in their bid to usher in the opposition’s victory. An opposition victory in Syria, as is increasingly likely now the US has expressed an clear desire to see Assad deposed, would set Russia on the back foot. Most importantly it would again drive home the fact that on the international stage, Russia will not compete militarily with other great powers. Early in the conflict Putin pre-emptively declared he would not go to war over Syria, but when the United States pledges cruise missile strikes, and all Russia has left to give are assurances that what is broken will be paid for, it makes for a reliable measure of each state’s capabilities. For Syrians it is unclear which eventuality they should fear the most: the “more oppressive and more anarchic” Assad regime, heavily dependent on foreign powers (to which it owes a lot) and infected with an insurgency that could take many decades to overcome, or, Stephen Walt’s projection of Syria “the failed state,” where the “bitter struggle among competing ethnic, sectarian, and extremist groups” creates the “ideal breeding and training ground for jihadists.” There is no honest answer to this question, and in a country as diverse as Syria, neither is necessarily mutually exclusive; all that is certain is that there will be a great deal more bloodshed before either side will accept defeat.

22,"Trident: A Necessary Renewal?","2013-02-15 00:00:00","Matt Finucane",null,"There is a lesser-known review in progress, headed by Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, over what 40 years ago would have constituted Britain’s most pressing security concern. This review on the renewal of Trident missile systems and the Vanguard-class submarines that launch them will be handed to David Cameron and Nick Clegg in the following two months and published shortly afterwards. The final decision will be postponed until 2016, promising to be a major election issue. However, in light of the recent cuts to the defence budget (42,000 redundancies and counting), the £30–100bn decision to renew has resurrected the question: does Britain need the bomb? On the New Statesman’s blog, Norwich South’s Labour candidate, Clive Lewis, writes of the “opportunity the Labour Party must not miss” to disarm after Trident expires. At a time when conventional forces—those we actually use, he posits—are facing drastic cuts, such an expenditure on weapons designed not to be used is unthinkable. Indeed it is difficult to overstate the madness of Mutually Assured Destruction as an “insurance policy” (that in the event of a launch, both sides would entirely annihilate each other), but, the conclusion that Britain should entirely disarm is an erroneous one. In a world where less-than-congenial states—despite the efforts of the nuclear powers—are completing nuclear tests, retention of a nuclear deterrent is essential. It is not, however, a matter of wreaking untold destruction upon the citizens of your foes. The simple truth is: membership of the nuclear club is the only guarantor against the kind of leverage that a nuclear state can wield against your interests. The veracity of this claim can be seen in the actions of North Korea and Iran today; it is the same fear that drives them, as drove all other powers in 1945. The present debate about alternatives to Trident has nonetheless laboured under the black-and-white fallacy that we must either disarm, or maintain the present capacity for total annihilation. Remedy to this falsehood, coincidentally lies with another local figure: Solly Zuckerman, Government Chief Scientific Advisor in the 1960s, and namesake of UEA’s Zuckerman Institute (ZICER), advised Harold Wilson on nuclear policy during the Cold War. While never an advocate of unilateral disarmament, the revulsion he held for the power of nuclear weapons—and their proponents—led him to vigorously counsel for a limited nuclear deterrent. In an age of austerity such as our own, this advice is as pertinent as it’s ever been. CC image courtesy of Defence Images, Flickr.

23,"The French Should be Cautious in Mali","2013-02-01 00:00:00","Matt Finucane",null,"France’s mission in Mali “has been completed”. Or so has been announced by the French Defence Secretary Jean-Yves Le Drian. This statement came after a number of key cities, among them Timbuktu, were liberated by French forces as of Tuesday. The French administration however would be advised not to make such suggestive statements of only semantic truth, when the situation in Mali bears so little semblance to political or military stability. They should also be cautious to avoid many of the mistakes made in another of its ex-colonies, Indochina, some of which it has already begun to pay the price for. The first of these is the inadvertent arming of the opposition. When the United States began its combat role in the beleaguered Vietnam conflict of the early 1960s, they found themselves engaged with an enemy extensively armed with remnant French weaponry—long after the French had departed. This same dilemma is emerging now in Mali, only on a far more disastrous scale. France being the only nation to have dropped a considerable tonnage of weaponry and ammunition into Libya to aid anti-Gaddafi rebels, it is an appropriate irony that now it is French forces that have to deal with those arms that have found their way to Mali. Among them is the Milan missile system—until recently the backbone of the French infantry’s anti-tank capability—as well as various shoulder-launched anti-aircraft defences (of 20,000 delivered to Libya, so far only a quarter have been accounted for). It is no exaggeration to say that in the wrong hands, these weapons could challenge the French advantage in air and armour support. The second mistake—one made almost without exception by Western media—is the oversimplification of opposition forces in Mali. The same misunderstandings were made in Vietnam when the “Communists” were portrayed as a force of solidarity with uniform aims and objectives. Sixty or so years later it is the “Islamists” who threaten regional security. If it were not for the studious work of some alternative media outlets, we might never have known that of the seven prominent factions in Mali, only three are explicitly “Islamist”, and only four engaged in campaigns of violence. The third and indeed greatest mistake, is the belief that liberating a few key cities marks anything but the beginning of this conflict; it will be the rural areas where insurgent forces persist. With the news that French forces will begin to pull back having pacified Timbuktu, it seems the task of pursuing this insurgency-in-flight to the desert north will be delegated to the Malian army, and the additional 7,700-strong African Union force. An act of political expediency, perhaps? President Hollande’s decision to defer to Malian and African Union soldiers could be a disaster—there are already reports of Malian soldiers executing suspected insurgents and taking revenge on Tuareg peoples, the insurgent’s ethnic majority—but this decision is to his credit nonetheless. There is no telling how long the engagement in Mali could last, but it will likely be a protracted conflict. While the French military’s efforts have thus far been celebrated, it seems unlikely that the presence of an ex-colonial power will be endorsed indefinitely—especially so, once the daunting task of fighting the rural insurgency begins. The sooner Western forces stop leading combat missions (the French have so far led every mission), and adopt the supportive, instructive role soon to be bolstered by the British, the better. With news from Jobs Minister, Michel Sapin of France’s “total bankruptcy”, and the omnipresent fear of “mission creep”, this morphing of roles will likely be hurriedly prioritised.

24,"The Falklands Islands Dispute","2012-02-20 00:00:00","Matt Finucane",null,"And so, with the fast-approaching 30th anniversary of the Falklands War, begins the second round of opportunistic begging on the part of the newly re-elected Argentine president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner. The stage is set. Britain, as a result of defence budget cuts, is in an even worse position to defend the islands from invasion than it was in 1982. Kirchner, who won her election on 39% of the electorate’s blessing, is seeking desperately to solidify her presidency. And what better way to do this than press on with her deceased ex-president/husband’s own brand of right-wing, territorial nationalism. The Argentinean claim to the islands is as simple as it is impudent. There was a period between 1820 and 1833 in which Britain ceased to hold a garrison on the islands (but retained a plaque declaring Britain’s continued claim of the islands). During this 13 year period the newly independent Argentina believed the islands were granted to them by Spain, irrespective of Spain’s inability to grant territory of the United Kingdom to any of its former colonies. When, in 1833, Britain returned, the Argentinean settlers were ordered to leave and promptly did so. The island was then officially colonised and that has been the political situation (bar one 74 day interruption) since then. There has been great speculation as to why Argentina has bumped up its claim for the islands recently. Indeed, this escalation was predicted by some when $20 Billion dollars of oil was located 220km north of the islands in 2010. Ever since the failed invasion of 1982 the islands have seen their most prosperous years, netting almost £20 million annually with living standards set to exceed those of mainland UK. This has done nothing to alleviate diplomatic tensions, it’s almost definitely raised them, and whilst the claimant’s prize looks ever greater, a claim to sovereignty must always be substantiated; a test Argentina has failed time and time again. The fact of the matter is this: the 3,000 inhabitants of the Falklands Islands hold among themselves the utmost desire to remain both British and under British rule. This, unfortunately, has not deterred the opposition thus far. More recent arguments ranged from the unsubstantiated: George Galloway’s piece on 10 o’Clock Live, which effectively conceptualised the belief that the Argentineans deserve the Islands on the grounds that the South American continent says so, to the absurd: Hollywood actor Sean Penn recently stated that the world today would not tolerate any “archaic commitment to colonialist ideology.” I present two situations to Mr. Penn: firstly that Britain, along with most powerful European states at the time, takes it upon itself to claim a predominantly uninhabited, uncivilised rock. The second is one in which Argentina, almost 150 years later, against the express wishes of the population of those islands, with the aid of a conscripted armed force, installs temporary control, and subjects the population to the authoritarian rule of its military junta. Now which of these sounds more like a malicious colonial action to you? CC image courtesy of RAYANDBEE, Flickr.

61,"Pahlavis Greatest Sin","2013-05-11 00:00:00","Maikel Nabil",null,"Pahlavis Greatest Sin >> 11 May 2013 #fullpost{display:inline;} “Those who dont know history are doomed to repeat it.” Edmund Burke I believe its very important, not only to read history, but also to ask yourself what would have happened if historic characters made different choices than the ones they did. This is one of the most important tools of learning politics, and practicing it in a model way. One of the interesting incidents in middle-east history, which we usually like to refer to, is the Iranian revolution in 1979. And the most interesting part of it is that no one realizes that the Shah, Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, literally chose every small thing happened to him. Historians like to refer to the Shah as a week leader, who had to flee his country running away from execution. But very few realize that he made a choice, and his choice was fatal, and he paid the price of his fatal choice. Pahlavi chose to westernize his country, to adopt the European fashions instead of the traditional ones, and to open his country to western culture and civilization. Pahlavi chose also to have good relations with Israel. Until 1979, Iran was the only middle-eastern country which recognized Israel, had full ties with it, and didnt expel its Jews as other Middle Eastern countries. And as Iran has lots of oil, Pahlavi chose to favor American and European oil companies, and kept a far distance from the Soviet Union and all the enemies of the west. In return to that, Europe hosted Khomeini and gave him an impact through its state-funded media. It was said that Pahlavi complained to UK because the BBC used to host Khomeini three times a week. And when the revolution started, all western countries sold him in a moment, and started normal relation with his enemies. Israel did nothing for him, nothing. Only Egypt received him in the first moment, and Sadat paid his life for this decision. Even Reagan exported weapons to Khomeini, just few months after the revolution, through Israel. In the end USA gave Pahlavi a retirement in its land, and of course he cant complain, as opening his mouth in this case will make USA send him with his family back to Iran to be executed in public. But we dont realize that Pahlavi had other options which he could have done, and he chose consciously not to do, even knowing that if he chose one of them he would have been in power with his family till today. Simply, Pahlavi could have done exactly what Khomeini did later. He could have boycotted Israel, adopted Anti-Semitic speech, and did like every middle-eastern leader instrumenting the Palestinian cause to distract his citizens from their actual problems. He could has taken American diplomats hostages, and traded them for the silence of the western countries. He could made extreme human rights violations, and executed over 100 thousands of his opposition, knowing that no one in the international society will care, exactly like no one cared when Khomeini did these things later. He could have tried to obtain nuclear weapons and threat to take the Persian Gulf back, destroy Israel, and nuke Paris and Berlin. If he did so, he would had been in power tell today, and would had a Nobel peace prize laureate like ElBaradei to defend Irans sovereignty, and maybe he would have been nominated to the Nobel Peace Prize himself, just like Adolf Hitler in 1939. But this wasnt the only solution in the Shah’s hands. He also had the choice to join the eastern bloc. He could have invented his own model of socialism, paint everything with red, write his own book like Stalin, Mao, and Qaddafi, gave more opportunities to the Soviet Union, and execute all the religious guys who were annoying him. If he did so, he would had the Russians fighting for him tell now, as they are doing for Assad today, and as the Chinese are doing for the North Korean dictatorship. The Shah wasnt weak; he just has the wrong allies. He committed the un-forgiven sin of being on the wrong side. He hanged out with people who dont appreciate friendships or ideologies, just pragmatic interests. Pahlavi fell, just because he chose to be our ally, not our enemy. If he was our enemy, he would have been the Shah of Iran till today. I’m here not denying that he was corrupt, and that he is responsible for the crimes made under his role. I’m just saying that he could have been more corrupt, and could have done more human rights violations, and still remain in power, if he had different allies. Why Im thinking in that? Just because the Pew Research Center has published its recent study, saying that 29% of Muslims in Egypt find suicide bombing justified. And knowing that nearly 10% of Egyptians are Christians, we reach a conclusion that only 20% of Egyptian voters consider the Palestinian Terrorism a resistance. This will include Islamists, Nationalists, and the radical left. But the crisis is that western countries dont see in Egypt except these 20%. These 20% are the ones receiving all of the international attention and support. They are the ones receiving the USA Aid and the EU funds. They are the ones honored in international ceremonies, and get the most famous prizes. They are the ones who meet Mr. Obama, get honored by Michelle Obama, and admired by the European Parliament. They are the ones who are considered credible resources for the international human rights organizations. Actually, the weakness of Egyptian Liberals isnt more than a self-fulfilling prophecy. After the revolution, Europe and USA thought that Islamists are strong, and Liberals are week, so they decided to buy Islamists. Huge amount of funds and politic support started moving from USA and EU to Islamists in Egypt. Even Israel used all its diplomacy trying to build contacts with Islamists, and ignored the other actors in the game. Islamists used this support to reach power in July 2012. Mohammed Hussein Heikal, an Egyptian writer who has been close to the Egyptian dictatorship all over his life, described the American pressure on the army to deliver power to Islamists, as 1942 incident in which the British troops surrounded the Egyptian kings palace to force him to change the government. We Egyptian liberals committed also the Shahs greatest sin when we considered Europe, USA, and Israel as allies. An ally is someone who actually supports you as much as you support him, which never happened with our so-called allies. Now we are paying for this mistake in our exile, and those we considered allies are paying also from their security.

64,"The War Over Blasphemy","2015-07-31 00:00:00","Maikel Nabil",null,"The War Over Blasphemy >> 31 July 2015 #fullpost{display:inline;} Photo: Demonstration outside the Saudi embassy in Helsinki, Finland on behalf of Raif Badawi (courtesy of Amnesty Finland via Flickr). Two weeks ago, Iceland abolished its 75-year-old blasphemy law. The parliament’s decision was a victory for the unconventional Pirate Party, which made the call to abolish the blasphemy law in Iceland after the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attacks in France. Churches in Iceland publically opposed this step, but this didn’t prevent the bill from gaining a vast majority in the Icelandic parliament. One month before, on June 7, Saudi Arabia’s supreme courts decided to uphold the sentence of 1,000 lashes and 10 years imprisonment on the Saudi activist Raif Badawi. Raif, the founder of the Saudi Liberal network, was originally detained in June 2012 on charges of blasphemy and apostasy. So far Badawi has served three years of his sentence and already received 50 lashes last January. His courageous wife Ensaf Haidar has initiated a huge campaign on his behalf. Raif was also nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize because of his contribution to freedom in Saudi Arabia. But it seems that all of that is not enough to get him released. Saudi Arabia isn’t the only country that targets blasphemers and nonbelievers. According to a report published by the Pew Research Institute in 2012, one out of every five countries has anti-blasphemy laws or policies, and one of every 10 countries penalizes apostasy. Both the Icelandic and the Saudi decisions show contrasting approaches to dealing with blasphemy these days. Countries like Netherlands, Norway, and Iceland are getting rid of their old blasphemy laws. Other countries, like Ireland, are introducing new blasphemy laws. And countries like Saudi Arabia and Egypt are increasing their persecution of blasphemers. The Saudi Hell Saudi Arabia is the last place an atheist or a blasphemer would like to be in. Not only is atheism classified as an act of terrorism and apostasy and blasphemy are punishable by death, but also because physical punishment is legal in Saudi Arabia. A blasphemer can be tortured and lashed for years before he is handed to the executioner. Saudi Arabia’s legal system is based on Sharia law, which is basically the instructions of the Quran, Hadith, and some other historic Islamic sources. But the main difference between Saudi Arabia and other Islamic countries that apply Sharia law is that Saudi Arabia doesn’t have written laws that define Sharia but leaves it to policemen and judges to interpret and implement the historic Islamic texts. And since the prophet of Islam, Mohamed, had ordered “You shall kill whoever changes his religion, Saudi judges would consider blasphemy an act of apostasy and punish blasphemers by death. Last April, the former Saudi king Abdullah issued a new decree criminalizing activities considered hostile to the kingdom and now defined as acts of terrorism. The Saudi Interior Ministry followed with a list of groups criminalized by this decree, and atheists were among those groups. The irony here is that terrorism is now punished in Saudi Arabia, according to the new decree, with 20 years imprisonment, while apostasy and blasphemy are punishable by death. But as atheists are considered terrorists as well, they will be punished under both laws. Raif Badawi isn’t the only one whom Saudi Arabia punished for blasphemy and apostasy. The kingdom has a long list of victims, and it’s hard to know most of the names in the list because of the country’s lack of transparency and efficient civil society. The Saudi Blogger Hamza Kashgari was hunted down in Malaysia, deported to Saudi Arabia, charged with blasphemy because of his anti-religious writings, and kept in prison for 20 months until he recanted his apostasy. The first act Kashgary did after being released was publishing a picture of him together with an Imam, receiving a gift of a copy of the Quran. In 2005, Hamza Al-Maziani and Muhammad Al-Harbi were sentenced to imprisonment and a whipping for blasphemy. Al-Maziani’s crime was writing an article about the quality of education in Saudi Arabia, and Al-Harbi’s crime was talking to students about chemistry and Judaism. In 2007, the general court of Jeddah sentenced Turkish National Sabri Bogday to death for “swearing at Allah.” Bogday remained in prison until 2009, when King Abdulla pardoned and deported him back to Turkey. Sabri’s release came, according to a Saudi diplomat, after he repented and asked God for forgiveness. But such harsh Saudi stance on atheism and blasphemy should be seen as a reaction not as an action. The Saudi authorities have been overwhelmed lately with the growing numbers of atheists in the kingdom. The Saudi royal family uses religion an essential tool to remain in power, and growing disbelief threatens their legitimacy. It has been reported that atheists represent now 5-9% of the Saudi population. In 2010, 7% of Saudis did not consider religion important in their lives. In 2014 only, Saudi authorities has blocked over than 24,000 websites, mostly atheist and pornographic ones. The authorities arrested 76 people because of some of these websites. Last January, Saudi atheists secretly held the first atheist forum in Mecca. Around a 100 atheists took part in this event. It was a shock to the Saudi regime, as Mecca is the holiest city for Muslims, and non-Muslims aren’t allowed to enter the city. The fact that organized apostates, who left Islam, could meet in Mecca was enough to drive the Saudi king to issue his decree three months afterward Sudan: Run By A War Criminal Sudan has many things in common with Saudi Arabia. Both criminalize apostasy and blasphemy, and both approve physical punishment including lashing. Sudan as well doesn’t have a properly developed civil society or free media, which makes it easy for the Sudanese government to target individuals without international attention. Section 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Law criminalizes blasphemy with punishments of imprisonment, fines, and up to 40 lashes of a whip. Apostasy, criminalized by article 126 of the same law, is punishable by death. The most famous blasphemy case involved Gillian Gibbons and became known in media as the “Sudanese Teddy Bear Blasphemy Case.” Gibbons, a school teacher, was sentenced in 2007 to imprisonment and deportation after she was found guilty of blasphemy. Her crime was that she used a teddy bear named “Muhammed” in her classroom, which the court considered blasphemous. Khartoum, Sudan’s capital, erupted in riots as religious extremists demanded her death. Gibbons’s British citizenship helped ensure that she returned safely to her country. Mohammed Taha wasn’t as lucky as Gibbons. Taha, the editor of the Sudanese newspaper Al-Wifaq, was an Islamist and a member of the National Islamic Front. Taha’s newspaper ran an article in late 2005 questioning the ancestry of the prophet of Islam. The Sudanese authorities detained, tried, and convicted him for blasphemy, and fined his newspaper eight million Sudanese pounds. Islamic radicals set fire to his newspapers and kidnapped him. He was later found beheaded. Egypt: Theocratic Military Junta Egypt’s legal system is a total mess. On one side, article 2 of the 2014’s constitution makes sharia law the main source of all legislation. But on the other side, article 64 of the same constitution guarantees the freedom of belief. Article 64 also restricts the freedom of practicing religious rituals to “heavenly religions,” a term used in Islam to refer to the three religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Article 7 of the constitution gives special status to the Al-Azhar mosque in Cairo, making it a kind of a state church. Many bills and court decisions are sent to Al-Azhar for approval before being issued. Egypt’s penal code, which goes back to 1937, criminalizes blasphemy in article 98. According to this article, only blasphemy against the three “heavenly religions” is punishable. In practice, most of blasphemy cases in Egypt are made against atheists and Christians, some against Shiite Muslims, and very few against Sunni Muslims. Al-Azhar, a conservative institution, has used every possible opportunity to put atheists and blasphemers behind bars. In 2006, Al-Azhar started a blasphemy case against the atheist blogger Kareem Amer. He was sentenced to four years in prison and became the first-ever Egyptian blogger to be imprisoned because of his writings. The authorities tortured Amer several times during his imprisonment because he left Islam. After the 2011 uprising, the Egyptian state started using every possible oppressive tool, including the anti-blasphemy article in the penal code, to silence the youth struggling for democracy. The number of blasphemy cases and convictions in Egypt in the last four years exceeds the entire number of such cases from the previous 30 years. The list of people charged with blasphemy after the revolution included the famous businessman Naguib Sawiris, Google, Charlie Hebdo magazine, and the former French president Nicolas Sarkozy.

The political outrage that erupted in January 2011 turned into religious and social outrage after the July 2013 coup. While the political revolution may be over, an intellectual one is clearly taking place. All the conventional pieties that Egyptians have revered over past decades have now become subjects of criticism and doubt. In recent weeks, a number of events and debates have exposed a deep rift between two camps of almost equal strength in Egypt: those who hallow their heritage and traditions, and those who champion of modernity, liberalism, and human rights. On April 6, Egyptians were incensed after learning that school officials in Giza burned books that they claimed incited violence while singing patriotic anthems—an incident recalling Nazi Germany. To make matters worse, representatives of the Ministry of Education were in attendance. Surprisingly, many of the books do not incite violence, such as Islam and the Foundations of Governance by Ali Abdul Raziq, one of the most important Islamic authorities to refute the concept of the caliphate and the existence of a system of governance within Islam. Abdul Raziq was one of the preeminent reformists in the Islamic world. Weeks later, Egyptian journalist Sherif al-Shoubashi called for a million-man protest in favor of removing the hijab. Shoubashi insists that the hijab has nothing to do with religion, and is actually a symbol of theocracy and political Islam. Shoubashi’s call sparked a debate between those who oppose the hijab on the grounds that it symbolizes the suppression of women, those who defend it as an Islamic prescription, and those who believe that women should be free to dress how they choose. Around the same time, on April 17, hundreds of thousands Egyptians watched television preacher Islam Beheiry argued with two Muslim sheikhs on air over several controversial matters in Islamic thought. According to Beheiry, books containing hadiths attributed to the Prophet Muhammad should not be considered as sacred. They also debated the permissibility of marrying minors, the punishment for apostasy, and the right of those who have not graduated from religious institutions to discuss religion. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi recently said that religious reform should come about through state institutions.

66,"How Egypt’s Conscription Generates Unemployment and Refugees!","2014-09-16 00:00:00","Maikel Nabil",null,"How Egypt’s Conscription Generates Unemployment and Refugees! >> 16 September 2014 #fullpost{display:inline;} While in Berlin, this spring, I met Egyptian twins who had to flee Egypt and seek asylum in Germany. They left Egypt, together, in March for several reasons, including their unwillingness to serve in the Egyptian army. They didnt want to be a part of the Egyptian armys systemic crimes. And, as Egypt doesnt recognize the right to refuse military service for conscientious reasons, they had to choose between prison and exile! These twins arent the only cases of this type that I witnessed. Last year, I assisted an Egyptian activist seeking asylum in the United States on the same grounds. I was also consulted recently about the case of a former Egyptian soldier who flew to Greece after being imprisoned in Egypt for escaping the military service. Actually, there is enormous number of cases like this in the last decades. This trend began in 1967 when Egypt started its six year military campaign to retake Sinai from Israel. In 1972, Netherlands rejected the application of, then deported, two Egyptian asylum seekers applying for refugee status because they didnt want to serve in the Egyptian army. I, personally, can’t understand the Dutch decision, because these asylum-seekers might have faced the death penalty as Egypt was at war at that time! The current conscription system in Egypt was installed immediately after the 1952 military coup. At that time, the junta government changed the military law enforcing an obligatory conscription of every Egyptian male between the ages of 18 and 30. And, even Egypt is a signatory of the International Covenant on civil and political rights which guarantees freedom of belief and conscience (article 18), and the Egyptian constitution guarantees freedom of belief (article 64), the Egyptian military regime still refuses to recognize the right to conscientious objection of the military service. Even in cases of Egyptian conscientious objectors like me, the Egyptian army only granted exemptions from military service on medical or security grounds, to avoid establishing a new precedent by recognizing the conscientious motives. I can’t deny that most Egyptians who try to evade military service dont do so for conscientious or ideological reasons. Conscripts in Egypt are mistreated and under-paid, and that the country has signed a peace treaty with Israel (the only country that Egypt fought after WWI), so, conscripts dont see a reason to waste three years of their lives in the army. Many young conscription-evaders are forced into an in illegal limbo, denied most of their civil rights until they reach the age of 30. The 1980 conscription law makes having the conscription completion document a precondition for studying at any Egyptian university, applying for any job, or issuing a travel document. Any employer who hires an applicant without conscription documents can be fined and imprisoned for two years. Thousands of conscription evaders, who cant be legally hired in Egypt, often end up in small boats crossing the Mediterranean either looking for illegal jobs in Europe or applying for refugee status. In NoMilService, Egypts counter-conscription movement, we experienced the financial consequences of evading conscription, while we were campaigning for our Conscientious Objectors. In 2012, Emad Dafrawi and Mohamed Fathi refused military service on conscientious grounds - they requested that the Defense Ministry allow them to serve in civilian positions instead. But, the Egyptian army ignored their cases, leaving them in illegal status, unable to work, study or travel. The same circumstances are now occurring with my brother, Mark Nabil, after the military stopped his conscription procedures last April on security grounds, but refuses to give him his conscription document disallowing him from working, studying or traveling. Mark graduated from university over a year ago, but, because the Egyptian military refuses to grant him his official documents, he has been unemployed and unable to travel legally during the last year, and will probably be trapped in this endless loop for months or years! Sadly, this isnt the only damage to Egypts economy caused by its army. The Egyptian military is deeply entrenched in the nation’s business sector, owning about 87% of Egypts land, and over one third of its businesses. Such intervention in the market drives competition away, and decreases the number of jobs. Military-owned corporations dont create jobs, because they use recruits as free labor. And, the recruitment of youths for years at the start of their careers creates obstacles in the paths of young people who want to become entrepreneurs. Conscription also deprives the Egyptian government of tax money which those young Egyptians would pay if they weren’t forced into military service and could, instead, work in a private industry. Many International actors, including the US government, support the Egyptian military, in the belief that Egypts army can restore stability, and, in doing so, stem the flow of refugees out of Egypt. But its the Egyptian military, through its stubbornness dealing with the conscientious objection issue, which generates refugees every day. The world sends billions of dollars in aid to the Egyptian military regime aiming in an attempt to stimulate the economy and reduce unemployment. But its the Egyptian army, with its hardline stance on conscription, which denies many Egyptians the legal right to work in Egypt. The Egyptian military regime must be pressured to ease up on its conscription law, allowing a legal status for those who dont want to serve in the army, instead of forcing them to be unemployed or flee the country!

It was a spring day, in April 2011, just few months after the revolution started. It was the fifth time I was detained in Egypt because of my activism. The agent feigned sympathy for my situation and asked me what had gotten me into all this trouble. He asked me if my parents or some family members were involved in politics and had gotten me involved. I told him that I was dragged into it against my own will. I originally wanted to be an author, writing only novels and short stories. But every time I have a negative experience, I write about it. So, I wrote about my feelings as a person who belongs to a persecuted minority in Egypt: Coptic Christians. I wrote about the unjust situations in my university. I even wrote about the bad treatment I received from my parents at home. And, every time I write about injustice, those in power use their authority to punish me, giving me more sad stories to write. It was an endless cycle: injustice leads to me writing about it, which leads to authority punishment and me writing about the new punishment and so on! … A few days after, I was sentenced to three years in prison, because I dared to write about the crimes committed by the military during revolution (including torturing me in 4 Feb 2011). Several months later, in October 2011, after I had spent two months on Hunger strike and had boycotted my retrial in the military court, a military regime judge sent me into a mental hospital to be evaluated. In front of a committee of three psychology experts, I found myself being asked the same question again: “What is activism and why did you became an activist?” I explained to them that the term “activism” comes from the word “activity”, and that whoever does a certain activity on regular basis is an activist. So, if you do political activity on regular basis, then you are a political activist. And if you do Human Rights activities on regular basis, then you are a Human Rights activist. I told them that blogging was the only tool I had to speak out about injustice. It was my only way to cry out, and maybe change things! After I was released from prison in January 2012, included in a general pardon, I started to hear those questions again: “what made you who you are? Why were you persistent and didn’t stop speaking even after you were detained five times and were exiled?” Several groups tried to study me and analyze how an activist is made, and why different people react differently to the same unjust situation. I was never able to give a convincing answer. I always thought it’s a moral choice: one person sees injustice and tries to fight it, yet another chooses to close his eyes and go on with his life. That was how I saw things until a few weeks ago, when I joined a big protest in Berlin in solidarity with refugees. I noticed that most of the protestors have another cause of their own; either being LGBT, or belonging to an ethnic minority, or having an immigrant background, or belonging to a marginalized political group or to a political party which was never in power. As far as I could see, no one was there from any of German four major political parties, which hold power in Germany. Somehow I realized that people become ready to invest time, effort and money to help others only when they are able to feel others. To logically understand their predicament is one thing, but to truly feel it is something else. These activists felt connected with refugees by shared injustice. Through protesting for cause of others, they were -- in a way -- protesting against the injustice they faced themselves. This allowed me to understand something more about myself. Maybe I defend minorities, because I am a member of a minority and knows how it feels to be treated as a second class citizen. Maybe I defend Children’s rights because I know how an abused child feels. Maybe I defend political prisoners because I was one, and I met, several times, my Mother’s uncle who was one as well. Maybe I defend LGBT rights, because I, myself, had to struggle for sexual freedom in the conservative, religious social environment in Egypt. Maybe I’m an Intactivist (activist against circumcision) because I know how it feels to have some part taken from my body without my consent. It isn’t that I can understand the situations of people facing injustice from afar, I can feel their pain, because it’s my pain as well.

Mark Nabil Sanad Last Tuesday, May 13th, My brother Mark Nabil had to go through his compulsory medical examination for the military service. He went very early to the army recruitment area in our home town Assiut, in upper Egypt. There were some 200 potential recruits with him that day. After the medical examination ended, they were given a paper poll for the military. This paper led Mark to a 6 hours investigations on Tuesday in Assiut’s military intelligence, and again over than 10 hours in the headquarter of the Military Intelligence in Cairo on May 15th. The poll contained five questions: Do you want to join the army? Did the Army support the people’s will? Did the army do what’s necessary for national security after 30 June 2013? Do you think that the army is a faithful patriot institution? Do you trust that the army will manage to end terrorism in Sinai? (photo of the poll attached) All the two hundred potential recruits marked “Approve” in front of all the questions, except for three; Mark and two others. Mark disapproved all the questions, and the two others disapproved only the point related to the 3rd July coup. Army officers at the site were very furious that someone dared to disapprove with the army role. The three individuals were called and requested with threats to change their answers. Under threats, the other two potential recruits changed their answers and they were let go. Mark on the other side refused to change his answers, and that’s how it started. Officers took him to the office of the military intelligence in the site and investigated him for six hours because of that. They took a list of names of all our family members, especially the ones living abroad. They investigated his politic activism and religious beliefs. Mark told the officer that he doesn’t believe in any religion. The officer tried to convince him to believe in God, and when Mark refused, the officer called our father to ask him how he tolerates his atheist son! The officer asked Mark also about my politic activism and imprisonment in 2011. They even made him write about my visit to Israel in Dec 2012. At the end of the six hours, they decided that this isn’t enough and that Mark should go on Thursday May 15th to the to the main office of the military intelligence in Cairo for further investigation. The day coincides the International Day for Conscientious Objection, in which pacifist organizations all over the world protest against forced recruitment. This incident triggered a campaign of threatening calls to Ahmed Hassan, the new leader of No to Compulsory Military Service Movement. Calls come from a secret number telling him to take an example of what happened to Mark and to stop writing about the military. And like Mark, such threats make Ahmed Hassan more energetic defending his cause. On Thursday 15th, Mark arrived on time to the headquarter of the military Intelligence in Rabaa Square in Cairo. They kept him for 10 hours without allowing him to eat anything, and made him spend most of that time either standing in the sun, or detained with other 12 persons in a small room. After that they investigated him in more details about my activism, and the circumstances of my trial in 2011. At the end they notified him to report again on Sunday to Assiut Military area to receive further instructions. On Sunday, Mark reported again to Assiut recruitment area, and again after keeping him for few hours, they instructed him to come again after 10 days for further instructions. It seems that the army will keep him for a while in a bureaucratic loop as a punishment for daring to disagree with the army’s policy. This situation reminded me with the last North Korean election, in which The Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland led by Kim Jong-un’s Workers’ Party received 100% of votes with over than 99% turnouts. Theoretically, Kim Jung-un doesn’t need more than 50% plus one to win the election. But it’s clear that in these totalitarian regimes, it isn’t allowed that even one individual disagrees with the government. Everyone has to agree with the opinions of the “big brother”, or else. That simply explains why polls in such countries don’t worth even the value of the papers they are printed in.

69,"What Egypt Needs to Do","2013-09-14 00:00:00","Maikel Nabil",null,"What Egypt Needs to Do >> 14 September 2013 #fullpost{display:inline;} A Prescription for Egypt Over two months have passed since the July 3 coup in Egypt, but nearly nothing new has been achieved. Assurances of reform by the new leadership differ little from the ones given by previous dictators, including Mubarak, Tantawi, and Morsi. The current legal framework is now essentially back to what it was during Mubaraks rule. The leaders of the new military government declared a state of emergency when they took over, and on Sept. 12 they extended it unconstitutionally for another two months. The new leadership is distracting us with its games: curfews, a few superficial amendments to the Egyptian constitution that leave its authoritarian core untouched, and an imaginary war on terror against groups that the government refuses to consider terrorists (the Egyptian army claims that it is now fighting units of Hamas, but insist that it’ a resistance group rather than a terrorist organization). The new Egyptian administration should stop playing games and trying to buy time. The oppressive laws of the dictatorship must be dropped immediately. A society cant undergo a transition if basic freedoms are restricted -- unless, that is, the transition is meant to be toward dictatorship. First, the Egyptian government must address the issue of freedom of expression. The authoritarian penal code criminalizes opinions, specifying some 20 specific views that can land Egyptian citizens in prison merely for expressing them. Section 14 of the Penal Code refers to journalism crimes, criminalizing such opinions as: encouraging recruits to disobey orders; erotic literature; affecting the reputation of the country; insulting the president; insulting a foreign president; insulting a foreign diplomat; insulting the army, the parliament, or the courts; and insulting a civil servant. And thats not even to mention Section 11, which criminalizes blasphemy. Thousands of Egyptians have been jailed or fined because of these articles since 1937 when the code was first issued. I was one of them, having been sentenced to three years in prison after I criticized the army in 2011. Im free now, but tens of others remain in prison for speaking out. We cant call a country democratic if its citizens are not allowed to criticize their government. How are candidates supposed to campaign in elections if they know that they can land in prison for the opinions they express while campaigning? A democracy is not a democracy without freedom of expression, and Egypt has to remove these oppressive laws if it wants to move forward. Second, Egyptian civil society should be allowed to function. The current civil society law was issued in 2002, and it restricts the activity of non-government organizations, threatening civil society activists with jail time simply for doing their work. All of us still remember how a court sentenced 43 NGO workers to prison on charges of receiving foreign funding. The same verdict also ordered the confiscation of documents from a group of nonprofit organizations, including the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, Freedom House, the International Republican Institute, and the National Democratic Institute. Egypt needs a civil society law that should guarantee four conditions: Citizens should have the freedom to form their own organizations. The government should remove restrictions on the political activity of NGOs. The state should be barred from interfering in the internal decisions of civil society groups. Finally, such groups should have full freedom to raise their own funding. If these conditions are met, then the countrys citizens will finally be in a position to build a strong civil society, a crucial precondition for the further democratization of the country. So far, however, the government has said nothing about reforming the current repressive law. Third, the government must allow outside observers to monitor elections. Egypt has not had a genuinely free election since a group of military officers abolished the democracy in 1952. It stretches credulity to claim, as his own government did, that Gamal Abdel Nasser was truly elected with 99.9 percent of the vote in 1956. Egyptians protested in 2011 against the parliamentary election held the previous year, which they believed had been rigged. The military then dissolved the parliament and arranged another election in 2011 that was so plagued by obvious fraud that Egyptian courts declared it illegal. There are cases now in front of the administrative court arguing that the 51 million names in the voter database contain around 13 million repeated and fake names (some 25 percent of the total). We can be sure that future politicians chosen in elections will also be accused of fraud if this issue is not addressed properly. After the July 3 coup, the new rulers have stated several times that they are prepared to accept international election monitors. But theres a catch. According to the transitional roadmap issued by the new government, the election is scheduled to take place three months from now, though most election monitoring missions need to spend at least six months in a country in order to set up operations. Since the Egyptian government has yet to issue any formal invitations to international observers, it should be clear that the military rulers have no desire to allow a clean election. And that, in turn, makes it almost inevitable that the next government in Egypt will face challenges to its legitimacy (especially by the Islamists), and that will lead to more instability in Egypt. Fourth, Egypt should abide by the international legal framework on human rights and elections. Over the past few decades, the Egyptian dictatorship has been notably reluctant to sign any international documents that would ensure greater freedom to Egyptian citizens. International organizations have very limited authority to monitor human rights violations in Egypt since the country has never signed or ratified most of the corresponding treaties. Foreign Minister Nabil el-Araby pledged in 2011 that Egypt would sign the additional protocols to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, but this never happened. If the new administration in Egypt wants to prove that a democratization process is under way, then it should sign and ratify both the additional protocols to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Rome Statute governing the International Criminal Court. Egypt should also join the Council of Europe and the Commonwealth of Nations. It defies common sense to claim that Egypt is a democracy while the countrys international participation is restricted to dictators clubs such as the Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. Egypt has now endured three years of profound instability. The economy is shrinking. Thousands have lost their lives in political violence. Embassies had been attacked. Egyptian territory has been used as a base for attacks on other states. If Egypt does not begin to face its real problems now, the chaos will grow. Neither Egypt nor the international community has an interest in allowing this to happen. This article was published in English in Foreign Policy’s Transitions blog.

70,"Are We Becoming Cowards?","2013-08-26 00:00:00","Maikel Nabil",null,"Are We Becoming Cowards? >> 26 August 2013 #fullpost{display:inline;} Last June, Tony Blair in his article commenting on Islamic extremism, referred to Islamic radicals “those with that view think we are weak and that gives them strength”. Blair didn’t agree of course with such argument describing “pluralistic, liberal, open minded societies” to be weak. I’ve lived most of my life in Egypt, surrounded by Nationalists and Islamists, who were repeating every day that westerners and Israelis are weak and cowards. They used to say that they “Islamists” love death as much as westerners love life. At that time, as I was seeing Nationalists and Islamists being defeated in every battle, I didn’t take their arguments seriously. I considered it part of “denial syndrome”. But as I grew older, I learned that the issue is not that simple. Few months ago, while studying China, I was surprised to know that the Chinese army was defeated when they invaded Vietnam in 1979. I asked a Vietnamese friend, a daughter of a Vietnamese veteran, “What’s your secret weapon? How you defeated both the Americans and the Chinese?” She said that they are being taught from their childhood that it’s fine to die for their country. That’s why they don’t care about anything when they struggle for their country. What Blair didn’t get, is that those suicidal fighters in Afghanistan, Egypt or Vietnam, who are unemployed, uneducated, under-nutritioned, and maybe deprived from sex, don’t have anything to lose. Their lives don’t worth anything in their eyes. On the other side, European or American soldiers chose to be in the military, not to die, but to have a career to help themselves to enjoy their lives better. A Jihadist dreams to die and becomes a martyr to be able to eat meat daily and to have sex with 72 virgins, while a European soldier dreams of a raise in his salary. Simply, That’s why USA will never win in Afghanistan. As long the majority of Afghanis are suffering from poverty and illiteracy, they will continue fighting. It doesn’t matter if they fight the Russians, the Americans or even each other’s. At the end, the need to kill themselves fighting, to escape from their horrible lives. The only way to convince them to stop fighting, is to spoil them with our good education and a good life! Obama’s last statement on Egypt is a nice illustration to this dilemma. As the Egyptian military for the last three years has made every possible offense. They killed and injured thousands of civilians. They may have used chemical weapons against civilians in Nov 2011. They attacked American foundations (NDI, IRI, and Freedom House), confiscated their computers and documents, and held American NGO workers in house arrest (including Ray LaHood, the son of the US minister of transportation) for a long time. they lunched an anti-American propaganda which lasts until today, and facilitated the attack of the Israeli and the American embassies. And after all that, the only reaction Obama made was cancelling the biannual joint military training exercise between USA and Egypt, which means that the 1.3 billion dollar military aid, paid from American tax-payers money, will continue to go normally to Egypt’s army. In my last visit to the USA congress in 2012, I was told that SCAF members who visited Washington DC few months before made it clear that they will drop Egypt’s peace treaty with Israel if the USA military aid was canceled. At that time I couldn’t understand why USA accepts to be blackmailed by a bunch of third world generals. And if the Egyptian army treats USA like this, how would they treat USA if they have oil or nuclear abilities like Pakistan or Iran? Some say that if the military aid was canceled, the first ones who will face damage are the American security companies who are benefiting from the aid, creating damaging effects on employment rates and tax revenues in the aiding country. Of course the Egyptian generals know that, and uses this in each chance. Last Tuesday, USA Principal Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest expressed this difficulty saying “providing foreign assistance is not like a spigot. You dont turn it off and on, or turn it up or down like a faucet”. Isn’t it strange that the superpower in our planet can’t take a decision about aids it’s giving, and has to continue unwillingly to arm a bloody dictatorship like Egypt? If so, who is the weak side here? Compare Obama’s behavior to George W. Bush crusades in Afghanistan and Iraq, which makes the one wonder if Syrians would have avoided their recent suffering if Bush was in the White House today! In response to the last massacres in Egypt, The Council of the European Union decided to stop exporting any weapons to Egypt. Egyptians didn’t take such decision seriously. First because Europe didn’t stop military cooperation with Egypt, which includes running projects of training Egyptian military officers. Second, because they know that Egypt still can import European weapons easily through Saudi Arabia or Israel. Third, and that’s the important point, because Egyptians know that Europeans don’t have the guts to stop exporting weapons to Saudi Arabia. Simply, Europe can’t claim to be moral by stopping weapons exportation to Egypt’s army “the small demon”, while continuing weapons exportation to the Saudi army “the big demon”. In most of my speeches and media interviews in Europe and Israel, people usually ask me the same questions “weren’t you afraid to stand against your government? Are you afraid to go back to Egypt? Are you afraid from being imprisoned again?”. In fact such questions doesn’t make sense to me. I was detained five times in Egypt, exposed to torture, and could be assassinated in any country if I crossed the red line. I may never recover from the traumas I got in Egypt. Prison and death lost their abilities to affect my decisions. I was smiling after I was sentenced to 3 years in 2011, telling other prisoners that I’m lucky not being killed! But after a year living in Europe, I started to feel that I’m changing. I’ve lived all my life in Egypt an outlawed, and never cared about that. Now in Germany, I’ve become more interested in following laws and respecting them. I started facing hard questions which I never had to face before, like how to eat healthy food, or how to enjoy a weekend. Life in democracies are spoiling me. I’m not a holy worrier anymore! Francis Fukuyama in his book “The End of History” said that democracies grow to become “a paper tiger”, scary like a tiger, but weak like a paper. The west may have nuclear weapons, but they are not useful if your enemy knows that you can’t use them. The nice life we have in the first world, which made us vegetarians and pacifists, wouldn’t help at all when we face barbarians. As blood and animalian power is the only language they speak.

71,"They Burned My Church","2013-08-15 00:00:00","Maikel Nabil",null,"They Burned My Church >> 15 August 2013 #fullpost{display:inline;} They Burned the Churches and With Them, My Childhood Yesterday, a few minutes after the Egyptian police attacked the Muslim Brotherhood sit-ins in Cairo, Islamists started targeting Christians (Copts) and Churches all over the country. Over 25 churches were burned down, and lots of shops and private properties of Christians were robbed and destroyed. Among the burned ones was the Adventist Chapel in Asyut, the place where I attended my Kindergarten for around two years. I remember how I didn’t like it because one of the servants there used to hit me. I remember also how I used to smell the lemon trees in the chapel Yard. After burning the Adventist Chapel, Islamists in Asyut burned down St. George church also. Nuns had to flee the church to surrounding buildings, while Islamists took furniture from the church and burned it in the street. I used to pray in this church for six years, and had my Sunday school there for more than 14 years. I had lots of good and bad memories related to this place, which once I considered my home. I don’t consider myself a Christian any more. Since I became an atheist in 2007, I faced lots of harassment from Egypt’s Christians. As the Coptic Orthodox Church has medieval beliefs, similar to how Catholics were in the middle ages, they went crazy because of my convert to atheism. Priests visited me in my house and threated me not to spread my atheist ideas. Rumors were spread against me by church servants. Some Christians even tried to put me in jail for blasphemy, while others were inciting the army to put me in jail again. But for me, as I follow what’s happening to Christians in Egypt right now, I’m forced to remember what happened to the Egyptian Jews 70 Years ago, when The Muslim Brothers did the same thing by bombing Synagogues and burning Jewish properties. At that time Egypt had around 80 thousand Jewish citizens. After the coup of 1952, Nasser joined the Muslim Brothers in the campaign against Jews. Nazi criminals were given refuge in Egypt, while Egyptian Jews were driven to concentration camps. The Egyptian army later deported most of the Egyptian Jews, and removed their citizenship, after robbing their properties. Now there are less than 100 Jews in Egypt. After that, other religious memories were targeted also. Shiite Islam and Baha’ism were banned by law, with their properties given to Al-Azhar. Christians were targeted by both Islamists and the army. The same army which USA funds, while this army forces recruits to yell every day “No God Except Allah, Mohammed in the prophet of Allah, Jews are enemies of Allah.” The same army which massacred the Christian protest in Maspero in Oct. 2011, leaving over twenty Christians killed, and before that in February 2011 attacked monks in St. Bishoy Monastry with RPJs, while soldiers were enjoying breaking crosses. Violent attacks happens against Christians every day by Islamists, while the state makes sure each time that the predators are not prosecuted. In the same time, Ayman Youssef Mansour, Gamal Abdu Massoud, and other Christians are in prisons now for blasphemy, because they expressed their Christian beliefs on Facebook. My fear is that Egypt’s Christians are going to face the same destiny as its Jews. As of now, over 4 million Egyptian Christian have left the country already, leaving behind around 8 million more (The Third has left). Now, as Egypt may face a civil war after the July 3rd coup, massacres against Christians would happen more, rousing more fears of a new holocaust. I’m not sure what could be the solution for this problem. The Egyptian army is quite racist, and won’t protect Christians. Western countries and Israel have lots of security interests with the Egyptian army, and wouldn’t risk it even for 8 million Christians. If Ben-Gurion didn’t do anything for Egypt’s Jews, who would do anything for its Christians? The issue even becomes more complicated with Europe trying to be nice to Islamists to contain terrorism in Europe. In the past, Jews tried to escape Germany and run away from the Nazi rule, but nearly no country accepted them. USA turned back ships of Jewish refugees sending them back to death in Germany, while UK prevented them from immigrating to Palestine. England was quite nice to accept only Jewish kids under the (The Kindertransport), to make sure they didn’t have their Bar Mitzvah, and thus not Jewish yet. I believe Egypt’s Christians (and also Syrian Christians) could be facing the same destiny. They are a minority who have been prosecuted it this country, with racist state institutions that planned for decades to extradite them, while the world is unable to take any measures to ensure their safety. For a long time, I believed that Christians (and other religious minorities) shouldn’t leave Egypt. I was saying that they should stay and struggle for their rights. I myself untill now refused to apply for asylum or to have another passport, to make sure that I’m going back to Egypt after I finish my master study in Germany. But some Coptic activists believe that western countries should open their borders to Egypt’s Christians before a genocide happens. They may be right. I won’t like to risk other people’s lives for my ideology. In the end, I believe that people should have to right to choose for themselves. But, will the free world take responsibility at this moment, and offer a refuge for these minorities? Or will we just keep watching, pretending that nothing happening until it’s too late? ... Building memorials and recognizing genocides won’t bring people back to life! This article was published in English in The Huffington Post, and in Dutch in The Volkskrant.

I was happy that she invited me to her place. She opened the door immediately after I rang the bill. Few seconds after she closed the door, the bill rang again. She opened the door, and a gang of men invaded the place. They were dressed in black clothes, and using black masks. They tied me on the couch, and took her to the bedroom, where they raped her in front of my eyes. In the end they hanged her in the ceiling, and slayed her. Before locking the door as they were leaving, they told me that they will leave me inside to call her husband and tell him about what happened to his wife. Then they locked the door, from outside, and left. Kill the asshole! My friend, the activist, was quite happy that Im visiting his city. He did his best to show me around the city. When it started to become dark, we decided to go back to his house. He suggested to show me the place of our dead friend. The building looks like a dormitory. He opened the door with his keys. The room had one huge window. He told me that some middle-eastern looking guys came to his room and threw him out of the window. I moved closer to the window and looked down to the grass downstairs. I remembered Soad Hosny and Ashraf Marwan. I remembered also Baklys question Why they chose to live in such high floors?” I looked to the window again. It looks like my window. I live now in the 7th floor!! Ignore him! I was in the bathroom brushing my teeth. Then a girl, whom I don’t know, entered. She started taking off her clothes, and then she went to the shower. Her unshaved red pubic hair didn’t look nice. She was ignoring me totally, and reacting as if I’m not in the place at all. I didn’t understand what’s happening. If she was seducing me, why she doesn’t send any welcoming signal, or even a smile? And if she is annoyed from me being in the place, why she doesn’t ask me to leave? Stone the infidel! I was walking out of Erfurts main church. I wasnt there to pray. I was just crossing through it in my way home. They told me to avoid this way, because there are some kids throwing stones at people who are coming out of the church. I didnt listen. I passed through some iron doors like the ones we had in our house when I was young. Then I reached outside to the sun, and the kids started throwing stones at me. I didnt try to face them, or even to look at their faces. I covered my head with my arms to avoid injuries. The stones didnt hurt me, so I avoided the confrontation. I just cared to reach my home. In my way, I was wondering about these kids motive. Why they are throwing stones at people who are going out of the church? Are they Muslims? But they are just kids, how they became like that? Where are their parents? Inside me, I was ashamed from the fact that Im walking out of a church. I remember Kareems comment You are thinking in believing again!” I remember how I tried to be religious in the past, but never was able to feel better because of religion. My shame from my Christian past made me avoid confronting the kids. I dont want anyone to see me walking out of a church. Jail the traitor! I dont know why I had to go back to Egypt, but I realized that another military coup had happened. Soldiers, with their disgusting clothes, were everywhere. An officer told me that they canceled my military exemption, and that I have to serve in the army. I told him that this will never happen. Soldiers kept telling me that I have to serve in the army, and I kept telling them that I wont. Then they started to grab me, to take me against my will. I resisted with violence. I pushed them back, and tore their clothes with my hand. I was very angry. I was ready even to kill, to maintain my freedom of choice. In the end they put me in jail with a handful of other innocent people. The prison cell looked like my previous school classrooms. I told the other prisoners that all of them were arbitrary detained. None of them has committed any crime. We should start a hunger strike...They refused the idea. I looked at them and thought that they are just slaves. They wont fight for their freedom. I have to decide on this issue on my own. While thinking in that, I noticed something moving in my pocket. Its a small vibrator. I turned it off. This is not the proper time for that kind of instrument! Dreams? Usually when I wake up from my dreams, I wonder if this was a dream or just a memory from the past. And Im still wondering!

Last Sunday, Violence blew up in the Bangladesh capital Dhaka, leaving at least 30 dead people behind. The violence was organized by a collation of Islamic groups call themselves “Hefazat-e Islam” which means in Arabic “Protectors of Islam”. Islamists took the streets chanting “Hang Atheists”, aiming to abolish the secular regime, and start hunting atheists. This wasn’t the first time that this violence happens in Bangladesh. Last September, a Muslim mob destroyed twelve pagodas and more than fifty Buddhists houses in Ramu in Bangladesh because of a Facebook photo derogating the Koran. Your god is illegal Actually the problem is rooted in the legal framework which delegalize religious groups. Indonesia, as an example, has around 86%. Muslim population. Constitutionally, the country acknowledges six different religions: Islam, Christianity (only Protestantism and Catholicism), Buddhism, Hinduism, and Confucianism. Ahmadiyya and other religious groups are not permitted to practice. Christians need special permission to build churches. Last October, in the country’s island of Sumatra, a Special Aceh District provincial government shut down nine churches and 6 Buddhist temples in Aceh’s capital Banda Aceh. Egypt has a similar story, with authorities which don’t recognize any religions besides Sunni-Islam and Christianity. They claim that they also recognize Judaism, but it’s hard to believe that in a country expelled its 80 thousands Jews in the 1950s, and just shut down its last active synagogue this past September. Many of Bahais, Shiite, Mormons, Buddhists, Hindus, Jehovah’s Witnesses, and others are not allowed to practice their religions in Egypt, and if they did, they would be arrested immediately. Christians are not permitted to build churches without the express permission of the President, something, they rarely get. Registration of religious groups exists in Europe, USA, and other free countries. But in these free countries, registration is just a bureaucratic process, which usually doesn’t consume time, and made mainly for tax-exemption. But obviously, countries like Egypt and Saudi Arabia are using the registration process as a way to prevent people from their human right to practice their beliefs. Saudi Arabia has gone a bit more far than Egypt. Beside requiring being a Muslim for the Saudi citizenship, and limiting access to some cities only to Muslims, Saudi Arabia forbids practicing any other religion on its land except Islam. No one is allowed to build a church, synagogue, or any other places of worship in Saudi Arabia, except Mosques. Christian foreign workers usually got arrested by the Saudi police if they gathered in any house to pray together. In Azerbaijan, 4 Baptist Christians were arrested in November for gathering together in prayer without permission, at a private house. The police raided the place, cut the electricity, and arrested the owner of the place and 3 others. The four arrested were tried that same night, and imprisoned. Local churches in the region complained that their applications for recognition from the state have been blocked by bureaucracy. Jailed because of their belief Pakistan decided to hit a record with blasphemy cases. The German newspaper Der Spiegel says that in the last two decades, there have been more than 1200 people accused of blasphemy, and that there is more than 100 cases still pending. Spiegel also mentioned that nearly 50 of these people were murdered after they were released. Last August, A Christian girl was arrested after she was accused of burning some papers of the Koran, and she is still being detained. The most recent arrest of a school teacher Arifa Ahmed and Asim Farooqi, the headmaster of the Farooqi Girls School in Lahore, were the cause of an angry mob protesting an English test which contained some words considered to be insulting to the Prophet Mohammed. Blasphemy cases exist in most of Muslim countries. In Iran, Farshid Fathi Malayeri is serving a 6 year sentence since 2010 for converting from Islam to Christianity. In Saudi Arabia, the writer Turki Alhamad, the blogger Hamza Kashgari, and the Founder of the Saudi Liberal Forum Raif Badawy are jailed and being tried now for blasphemy, which may result in the death penalty. In Kuwait, Abdel Aziz Mohamed Albaz was sentenced to a year in prison with forced labor for his blog Benbaz. In Indonesia, Alexander Aan’s Facebook comment ‘God doesn’t exist’ resulted in a Two and a half year jail-term this past June. In Morocco, the new Islamic government arrested the Atheist activist Mohammed Socrates, accusing him of dealing drugs, and sentenced him to 2 years imprisonment after he confessed under torture. In Tunisia, courts have sentenced two activists Jabeur Mejri and Ghazi Beji to seven and a half years in prison for blasphemy also. In Egypt, Ayman Youseef Mansour, Gamal Abdou Masoud and Mohammed Asfour are serving a three year sentence for blasphemy, while Makarem Diab Said and Bishoy El-Beheri are serving six years for the same alleged crime. It’s sad that some European countries like Germany, Ireland and Denmark still have blasphemy laws. We understand that these European laws haven’t been used for decades. But at the same time, these laws are used as an excuse by Authoritarian governments to take the freedoms of its citizens. Lots of work still needed on our planet, cleaning dirty laws of free countries, and pressuring un-free countries to recognize freedom of belief. Islamic Human Sacrifices Indonesia also is facing this phenomenon of Islamic violence. Eid al-Adha or Feast of Sacrifice turned bloody last year, as The Islamist Defenders Front (FPI) attacked Ahmadeyya congregations, preventing them from celebrating their Feast. While in February 2012, merciless tortures and killings of Ahmadiyya at the hand of Islamists took place in Cikeusik, while they were shouting Allah Akbar “God is great.” The perpetrators were only sentenced 3-6 months and the court blamed the Ahmadiyya for inciting the attack. In April 2012, an attack occurred in a Shiite community in which two people were killed in Sampang, Indonesia. At least 270 refugees were left after the attack. In Sampang, Sunni Muslims attacked Shiite houses last October, leaving nearly 200 Shiite without a home, displacing them, unless they’re willing to convert to Sunni Islam. In Malaysia also you can see the same phenomenon. Christians complains that some former Muslims who converted to Christianity have been tortured, and forced to return to Islam. A doctor was arrested for seeking childcare from a church, and could face a three year sentence. A tuition center was shut down by the Education Ministry this past August, following claims that the teachers were trying to convert several Malay Muslim children studying there. A church was raided after a complaint was received that it had attempted to convert the twelve Muslims that attended the dinner. Back to Africa where Nigeria’s Islamic extremists “Boko Haram,” which means in the Hausa language “Education is sinful”, celebrated Christmas in 2011 by bomb blasts and shootings at churches in Madalla, Jos, Gadaka, and Damaturu, leaving 41 people dead. Boko Haram is known for targeting churches, universities, police stations, and even the moderate Muslim Cleric, Liman Bana. The organization is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of people and remains active, using terrorism against non-Muslims and Muslims, pushing Nigeria back into the Medieval Ages. In Egypt, the army used the chance of the revolution to invade St. Bishop monastery in Feb 2011, and shot monks with RPJs. The same army attacked the nonviolent Christian demonstration in Maspero in October 2011, and left behind at least 28 people dead, and over 200 injured. To this day, not a single person was prosecuted for the massacre of Christians in El-Kosheh in 2000, in which 21 Christians were killed. Islamic extremist groups are known to burn churches every couple of months, and are protected by the state, not forgetting the habit of bombing churches at Christian feasts, like what happened in Alexandria 2011, and Nagahamadi 2010. In March 2011, a Salafi group burned a Christian house in Qena, and cut an ear of its owner, because the attitude of a girl living at that house was considered inappropriate. Few months later, a court announced the predators “Innocent”. Final Words The crimes of Islamic extremist groups are widespread in Muslim countries: Harakat al-Shabaab al-Mujahideen (HSM) in Somalia, the Taliban in Pakistan and Afghanistan, Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza, The Revolutionary Guards in Iran, and the Salafis in Egypt and Tunisia. Not to mention the Islamic government in Sudan, which wanted to apply Shariaa laws over the Christian south, leading to two civil wars, resulting in hundreds of thousands of killings, and millions of refugees. The south is happily separated now, but Islamic Militias are still killing and raping Sudanese women in Darfur, while the government is blessing the predators. The International Criminal Court hasn’t arrested yet the Sudanese President Hasan Elbashir for his war crimes. Both of us live now in Europe, where being a believer or not is completely a personal freedom. But we understand that people in other parts of the world don’t enjoy the same freedoms. That’s why we are calling on the Free World to pressure these countries to respect the international standards of Human Rights.

Last Tuesday, peace activists of “No to Compulsory Military Service Movements” protested in Talaat Harb square in Cairo, just a few meters from Tahrir Square. The Egyptian Conscientious Objectors Emad Dafrawi and Mohammed Fathi carried posters calling for the freedom of the Israeli Conscientious Objector Natan Blanc. Natan, for those who don’t know him, is a 19 years old Israeli citizen imprisoned now in Israel for refusing to serve in the Israeli army. Natan has been military-tried 8 times until now and served over 120 days in Detention, and will most likely have his ninth military trial this week on April 15. Natan said in his Objection declaration that he has reached his decision upon Cast Lead Operation in 2008, when he noticed how this war fueled negative feelings in both sides, and induced a wave of militarism in the Israeli society. In a video statement he made a few weeks ago, Natan spoke against the Israeli occupation to west Bank, and said that it’s not democratic to prevent Palestinians from voting in Israeli elections as long as they are living under the Israeli state. Every Israeli citizen is obligated to serve in the IDF when they reach 18-years of age (three years for males, two years for females). Israel maybe the only country in MEMA region which its laws recognize the right to refuse the military service for reasons related to belief and conscience. But on practice, the Israeli army has been very strict in their interpretation of who qualifies as a conscientious objector, and sends most people that refuse military service to prison for disobeying military orders. In order to circumvent the army, Israeli youth have managed to find some loopholes by claiming to have psychological troubles (According to New Profile activists, nearly 4% of Israeli youth get exempted from the military service each year by this way). The interesting thing about Natan is that while he could have copied the practices of other abstainers, he refused in order to emphasize his opposition to the practices of the IDF. In Egypt it may be a bit worse. Egyptian laws don’t recognize the right of Egyptians to refuse military service on basis of belief or conscientious. In 2010 I was the first Egyptian to refuse the military service for contradiction with my morals and principles. The military ignored me for nearly a year, and then in Nov 2010 I was kidnapped by the military police from my house. I was released next day after being exempted from the military service on the grounds that I was suffering from Acute Personality Disorder according to them, (A disease that hasnt yet been discovered by psychologists.) After the military took power in Feb 2011, one of the first things the military did, was arresting me again, accusing me of spreading false information that affected the reputation of the army, military trying me, and sentencing me to 3 years in prison. Luckily the international society reacted, and I was released after 10 months and 130 days of Hunger Strike. In 2012, two other Egyptian activists announced their refusal to serve in the army for contradiction with their conscious. The first was Emad Darawi, the editor of ‘Children of Peace’, an Amateur linguistic and a graduate Journalism collage. He is also a famous peace activist who promoted good relations with Israel for a long time. Emad told the Jerusalem Post last January that the Egyptian dictatorship is responsible for the anti-Israel incitement, and that most of Egyptians don’t have a problem with Israel. The second is Mohammed Fathi, the editor of “All colors”, who was very offended by the violence of the army against civilians after the revolution. As a vegetarian peaceful person, he decided that his conscious can’t accept obeying military orders of such army. Both Emad and Mohammed continue to live in limbo since the day they refused to report to the military recruitment center. Without documentation from the army saying that they have finished their military service, they are barred from taking part in fundamental aspects of society. They are not allowed to work, and hiring them is punishable by 2 years imprisonment. They are not allowed to travel, or even to have passports. They are not allowed to study at any Egyptian university. And of course the military can arrest them at any moment, military-try them, and send them to jail for long years. The Egyptian authorities, even the constitution guarantees the freedom of belief, have been ignoring all their requests to serve in an alternative civilian service. All the Egyptian Human rights organizations abandoned them because of their peace activism, and until now there not a single Human Rights Lawyer accepted to represent them legally. Even international Human Rights groups like Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and the United Nations Human Rights Council have never mentioned their cases. Last week I contacted the Israeli Foreign Ministry considering Natan’s case. Surprisingly, they reacted in the same way as the Egyptian authorities. They just ignored my message in a manner indicative of the Israeli and the Egyptian governments disregard for human rights criticism, choosing instead to go forward with their policies that make their citizens suffer. The problem in Middle East is not that we lack peace activists. The problem is that our Governments keep peace activists busy fighting for their basic rights, instead of letting them free to build peace.

75,"The Great Wall of Israel","2013-03-03 00:00:00","Maikel Nabil",null,"The Great Wall of Israel >> 03 March 2013 #fullpost{display:inline;} Israelis, those walls are your prison “Walls don’t protect you. Walls imprison you!” It was obvious that some Israeli students didn’t like my statements. They interrupted my speech at the World Union of Jewish students’ (WUJS) conference in Jerusalem last December, singing a national Hebrew song. They didn’t like it when I said that the obligatory military service is a kind of slavery. A young Israeli student defended the Israeli military service system, urging that Israel needs its military service because all Arabs (including Egyptians) are anti-Semitic and want to abolish Israel. I asked him if he visited Egypt before. He said “No, but lots of people says so”. I advised him not to believe me or anyone, and to go to see reality by himself! In the North of Israel I faced the opposite experience. I was hosted by a nice Atheist Jew. He took me to the Lebanese borders, where we could see the Lebanese people crossing by, just a few meters from us. My host kept greeting them “Good Morning”, while the Lebanese seemed not to know how to react. I was a bit nervous trying to keep a low profile, so I asked my host to stop it. “How sad that we are living a few meters from each other,” he sighed “and we don’t even talk!!” A few days later, an Israeli academic accompanied me to Ramallah, secretly because of the Israeli law that criminalizes visiting most of Palestinian cities, including Ramallah. The Israeli laws also criminalize visiting what’s called “Enemy states” which include Iran, Syria, Iraq, and Lebanon. When we passed through the walls, he started speaking about the social impact of the barrier. “Palestinians and Israelis don’t and can’t interact any more. The reconciliation process has stopped. My children can’t meet their Palestinian friends as easy as it used to be” he says. No wonder then that the Israeli society keeps shifting to the right, since these walls were build! It’s sad that after the Egyptian revolution, Egyptians and Israelis lost their human communication which they had in the past. There used to be around half a million Israeli visiting Sinai each year, and some others visiting other parts of Egypt. Nowadays, The Egyptian Embassy in Tel Aviv seems to be putting obstacles in giving visas, while Israelis themselves have become afraid from visiting Egypt, even Sinai which they doesn’t need a visa to visit. For Egyptians it hasn’t changed that much, as it was very hard all the time for any Egyptian to get a visa to Israel, unless if he was affiliated with the dictatorship. Now, after the burning down of the Embassy, Israel closed its consular section in Cairo, upgrading the visa application process from “very hard” to “nearly impossible.” Since my release from prison last year, I’ve been lobbying every side to reopen the Israeli embassy in Cairo, but sadly both the Israeli and the Egyptian governments seem to be uninterested in doing that. Before I leave Israel, Netanyahu was celebrating completion of the separation wall between Israel and Egypt. Now there are walls separating Israel from Egypt, Palestine, and Lebanon. His joy inspired him to announce that he will start building a wall on the last un-walled border (with Syria). In the end of January, My movement “No to Compulsory Military Service” had a workshop in Berlin. We had an Israeli guest from the Israeli peace movement “New Profile” participating with us. In the end of the workshop he said that his dream is to walk on foot from his Father’s city (Tehran) to his mother’s city (Tunis). Obviously, lots of walls need to be destroyed in the Middle East to make this dream possible. I understand that most Of Israelis have very traumatic experiences from the second Intifada. It’s sad to see how deep the marks left by those suicide bombers are. But Israelis must overcome it. Because, simply put, more Israelis lose their lives in traffic accidents than as a result of the conflict. Actually, Israeli victims of domestic violence in the last 39 years number more than Israelis harmed by the conflict in the same period. I’m not trying to minimize the conflict; I’m trying to put it in its real size. If we wanted Palestinians and Egyptians to not believe that Israelis are “blood-sucking vampires”, and if we wanted Israelis not to believe that “all Arabs are terrorists,” both sides have to at least encounter each other in a regular daily manner. Meetings between citizens of both sides have to stop being a challenge done only by crazy or courageous people. The only way to fight conspiracy theories is for people to know each other on a personal level, and governments are responsible for creating the environment in which such meetings are possible. Eastern Germans weren’t liberated until they stopped seeing the Berlin Wall as security and started seeing it as captivity; and the same was true of Russians with the Iron Curtain. Israelis have to see that their government has transformed Israel into a big prison, surrounded by walls from every side. Israelis have to break down their walls. I can’t promise them that they will find only good people on the other side. They will find only human beings, just like them.

76,"Merkels Fascist Guest","2013-01-30 00:00:00","Maikel Nabil",null,"Merkels Fascist Guest >> 30 January 2013 #fullpost{display:inline;} Bloodsuckers, monkeys, and pigs -- thats how Egyptian Dictator Mohammed Morsy refers to Jews. Just two weeks ago, Morsi offended a group of USA Senators, by claiming that Jews control the international media. Morsi also belongs to the Muslim Brotherhood, the group whose leader Mohammed Badie was ranked by The Simon Weisenhall Centre (SWC) as the biggest anti-Semite in our planet. But the German Chancellor Angela Merkel decided to surprise us all, just a few days after saying that Germany has an everlasting responsibility for the crimes committed by the Nazis, by inviting the Egyptian Neo-Nazi leader to visit Berlin as her guest today, 30 Jan, the same date Hitler took power in 1933. This visit is an insult to Germanys struggle against racism, homophobia and nationalism over the past sixty years. Its worth noting that Chancellor Merkel, who belongs to the Christian Democratic Party (CDU), will be hosting a dictator whose government persecutes Christians on a regular basis. In Egyptian Prisons, there are now at least 4 Christians (Ayman Youseef Mansour, Gamal Abdou Masoud, Makarem Diab Said, and Bishoy El-Beheri) who have been jailed -- for up to six years -- simply for expressing their Christian Beliefs. This is not even to mention the sectarian propaganda released by the Muslim Brotherhood and the Egyptian Presidency against Christians, which reached its peak last September during the crisis over the film Innocence of Muslims (and which resulted in the destruction of the German Embassy in Sudan) . This campaign of religious intolerance continues today. This week, Morsys Muslim Brotherhood accused Egypts Christians of leading criminal groups that were responsible for the killings of more than 50 people during the past weeks anti-government demonstrations. We democratic activists in Egypt are extremely worried about any Military cooperation between Germany and Egypt. Germany has always been one of the largest exporters of weapons to Egypt (right behind the United States). Such worries are particularly pronounced at a moment when the Egyptian police and Army regularly use western -supplied weapons to crush nonviolent protests that call for freedom and democracy. I dont believe that German citizens accept the notion that they can only support their own economy by selling weapons to dictatorships like Egypt and Saudi Arabia, which stand against the rights of their citizens to live in freedom and equality. Mr. Morsi speaks a lot about respecting court decisions and the rule of law, but at the same time he is protecting a huge number of criminals who are responsible for the death of more than 1200 civilians (over 70 of them were killed after Morsi took power), the wounding of tens of thousands of protestors since the revolution started. Not a single police or military officer has been punished for these crimes. By contrast, the chief of the Military intelligence Abdel-Fattah El-Siessy who tortured me on 4 Feb 2011, received a promotion from Morsi, who recently appointed him as Minister of Defense. My official complains have been ignored by all legal institutions in Egypt. Chancellor Merkel, relations between countries presuppose a certain common ground of shared values. Diplomatic relations should not justify support for dictatorships. Otherwise you should also invite and host both Irans Ahmadinejad and Sudans Bashir. Im sure they are both eager to have better relations with Germany (and to buy more German weapons). As you know, Chancellor Merkel, your compatriots in East Germany took to the streets against communism and dictatorship in 1953, but their protests were crushed by a government that enjoyed the support of many powerful countries. Please dont help the rising Egyptian dictatorship to crush freedom with Germanys help.

77,"Let There be Peace","2012-12-11 00:00:00","Maikel Nabil",null,"Let There be Peace >> 11 December 2012 #fullpost{display:inline;} “The best way to predict the future is to create it.” Willy Brandt If we were living in Oslo in 1940, watching the young German dissident Willy Brandt, exiled from his own country, struggling against the Nazi army as it occupied Norway, not one of us would have predicted that this man would one day be the leader of Western Germany, play a role in German and European reconciliation and unity, and win the Nobel Peace Prize. The difference between Willy Brandt, Nelson Mandela, Aung San Suu Kyi, Martin Luther King, Jr, and us is that those people believed that they could make the future, that they can change things. And they did. I’m happy now to announce that I’m going to visit Israel and Palestine for the first time in my life, finally, after a long time of being denied travel by Egyptian authorities, and after being pushed away by the Israeli embassy in Cairo. I am scheduled to give my first speech on December 23 at the Truman Institute of The Hebrew University in Jerusalem, the same university which Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed, my godfather, represented Egypt at its opening ceremony nine decades ago. Later during my stay, I’ll also speak for The World Union of Jewish Students in 31 December 2012, and also for Tel Aviv University in 2 January 2013. I’ll also visit Ramallah (Palestine) to meet Palestinian activists. People around the world will be able to follow my trip through Twitter hash tag #MaikelinIsrael After years of calling for peace, I have realized that practicing peace is more important than talking. My visit is a message from the Egyptian peace community that we have had enough violence and confrontation and we want this to end. We want to live together as human beings without violence, racism or walls. I’m aiming with my visit to end the monopoly which governments have over peace processes. Our governments held this portfolio for decades, and obviously they have gone from one failure to the next. It’s time to open the process to other actors. If we couldn’t achieve anything, at least the competition will pressure politicians to work harder. My trip is organized by UN Watch, the Human Rights organization based in Geneva, which played a role in defending my freedom when I was imprisoned in Egypt last year for 10 months for defending Human Rights. Its director, Hillel Neuer, is known for his scathing attacks on dictatorships in The UN Human Rights Council. He is a very brave person, and a good friend. While applying for the visa, I opposed the idea of getting a visa to Israel without putting a stamp in my passport, to avoid being banned from entering countries which don’t allow those who visited Israel before to enter. I decided this simply because I don’t wish to visit any country which doesn’t recognize the right of any other country to exist. Having two passports or having a visa without a stamp is just encouraging racist regimes to continue practicing racism in the 21st century. Racist regimes should pay for their racism, not be encouraged by tourism. In the end, I received my visa on a separate paper. I’m sad that the state of Israel is adapting to this ugly situation. From the beginning, I decided also that I’m not going to visit any religious places, and I won’t meet any members of the clergy. Religions have been always part of the problem, not part of the solution. Fighting wars, racism and violence obligates me to avoid their causes, and religions are on the top of them. Middle-Easterners will be following my visit with their eyes. If I succeeded, more will follow. It can be a point of change in history. Anyone who cares about Peace is invited to do whatever he can do to make this visit succeed in improving the situation in the Mideast. In the end, I understand that I may face a horrible fate because of my visit. While walking in Jerusalem, I won’t be able to stop my mind from thinking about King Abdullah, Anwar Al-Sadat, and Yitzhak Rabin. But still, I’m willing to take this step, to put another brick in the wall, willing that others will follow doing the same thing, believing that one day we will be able to end this insanity which has been ongoing in the Middle East for centuries.

78,"Yes, I’m a blasphemer. Get over it.","2012-10-19 00:00:00","Maikel Nabil",null,"Yes, I’m a blasphemer. Get over it. >> 19 October 2012 #fullpost{display:inline;} On October 7, 2012, the office of the Egyptian General Prosecutor decided to start an official investigation accusing me of blasphemy -- or, as they call it, insulting Islam. My crime was expressing my atheist beliefs on my Twitter account. The Egyptian authorities also arrested my friend Alber Saber on similar charges. He remains in jail to this day. Egypt has signed many international treaties that ensure freedom of expression, but the Egyptian penal code still has approximately 20 laws that make certain opinions a crime. The specified offenses include criticizing the president, the parliament, the military, or the judiciary. Criticizing a foreign president, such as Mahmoud Ahmadinejad or Bashar Al-Assad, is also a crime, punishable with a three-year term in prison. When I learned of the charges against me and Saber, I remembered my friend Kareem Amer, a famous Egyptian blogger who was sentenced to four years in prison in 2007 for insulting both Islam and then-President Mubarak. Kareem suffered a great deal in prison. He was tortured several times, and spent a long time in solitary confinement under horrible conditions. The latest threat of legal action against me has also stirred up memories of my previous imprisonment last year, when I was imprisoned in Egypt for 10 months for the crime of insulting the institution of the military. Since then, two corrupt police officers, Sayyed Abdel-Kareem and Mohammed Abdel-Rahman, have declared that they want to file an additional case against me. Theyre both accusing me of insulting Islam during my imprisonment in El-Marg Prison. Theyve tried to use this new case as a form of blackmail to keep me from speaking about the torture I faced while I was there. (Their accusation is entirely separate from the case brought against me by the prosecutor, by the way.) Alber is not the only opinion prisoner in Egypt accused of criticizing Islam. There are at least six Christians (three of them under the age of 18), four atheists, and one Shiite who now face the same charges, and it is no surprise that not one of them is a Sunni Muslim. Its a new Inquisition happening in Egypt in the twenty-first century while the whole world remains silent. It started last year when Ayman Youseef Mansour, a 22-year-old Christian blogger, was sentenced on October 22, 2011 to three years in prison because he criticized Islam on his Facebook page. Egyptian courts later refused his appeal, denying him his right to reconsider the severity of the sentence. Aymans case was followed in January 2012 by the case of Gamal Abdou Masoud, 17, a Christian from Asyut in Upper Egypt. Gamal was tagged on Facebook in a picture that criticized Islam. Angry mobs surrounded his house because of this picture, burned his house and the houses of other Christians in the village, and forced his family to leave. The police didnt arrest anyone from the mobs. Instead, Gamal was sentenced to three years in prison for insulting Islam. Then, in April 2012, another Christian was imprisoned on the same charges. Makarem Diab Said, a teacher (also from Asyut), was sentenced to six years simply for using some aggressive words against Islam when he was quarrelling with one of his colleagues at work. Last month, on September 12, a court in Sohag sentenced another Christian, Bishoy El-Beheri to six years in prison for criticizing Islam and criticizing President Mohammed Morsi. This case is very similar to Kareems. The only difference is that in Kareems case he got only one year in jail for criticizing Mubarak, while criticizing the present president leads to three years. Earlier this month, the Al-Ahram newspaper reported that two Coptic Christian children ,Nabil Nagy Rizk, 10, and Mina Nady Farag, 9, were arrested for insulting Islam because they were caught playing with papers that happened to have some verses of the Quran written on them. The kids were released later, but the case against them hasnt been dropped yet, meaning that they can be jailed also for three years. On October 6, a female student, known only by her initials of B.R., went to the police station in Sharkia asking for help, complaining that her mother tried to poison her. But the authorities decided that the student and her boyfriend should be jailed because they are atheists who believe that premarital sex is not a sin. It is not only atheists and Christians who are being jailed in Egypt for blasphemy. A Shiite man, Mohammed Asfour, was sentenced to three years in prison last July for speaking against the crimes made by followers of Mohammed the prophet of Islam. Many others are in prison on the same charges and more will surely follow. The General Prosecutor has just sent a case against Google officials to the State Security Investigations department in Egypt, accusing the Internet Company of failing to block the movie Innocence of Muslims from its search engine. The prosecutor has also started an investigation against the poet Hisham al-Gokh, whom he accused of insulting religion in his poetry. These activists suffer because Egypt doesnt have an independent judiciary. Many cases take decades to go before Egyptian courts. But when the issue is political, they can finish the case in a few days, just as they finished my trial 12 days after my arrest in March 2011. They are now doing the same with Alber. Obviously there is a political reason for the Egyptian regime to jail him. They wish to intimidate Christians and other minorities to force them to leave the country. That is why Albers trial is being processed so fast in comparison with other cases in Egypt. If there was a proper international response, perhaps they would proceed with more caution. Alber expects to be sentenced to three years imprisonment within a short time. Meanwhile, though, there is a campaign supporting his freedom on Facebook and Twitter, which is gaining momentum every day. The worst part is that this phenomenon of jailing bloggers on charges of insulting religion is now becoming widespread in Muslim countries. In Saudi Arabia, young blogger Hamza Kashgari is now in jail on blasphemy charges, and could face the death sentence. In Tunisia, Jabeur Mejri and Ghazi Beji were sentenced on March 28, 2012 to seven and a half years in prison. In Morocco, Mohammed Socrates is spending two years in jail for his atheism, but the authorities in Morocco were smart enough to accuse him of narcotics trafficking, and there is no need to say that he confessed under torture. One might even include Malala Yousafzai, the 14-year-old girl shot by the Pakistani Taliban because of her public calls for secularism and female education. Religions are just collections of beliefs which cant be proved. I still cant imagine that in the twenty-first century there are people going to prison because they dont believe that someone walked on water, a virgin gave birth to a child, or a man flew to heaven on a donkey. Tolerating this new Inquisition moves our world back to the Middle Ages, and this could have devastating consequences for our lives.

Egypt has signed many international treaties which ensure freedom of expression, but the Egyptian penal code still has a list of approximately 20 laws that make certain opinions a crime. These opinion laws consist of: criticizing the president, the parliament, the military, and the judiciary. Criticizing a foreign president such as Ahmadi Nigad or Bashar Al-Assad is also a crime which could land any journalist with a three year prison sentence. And of course criticizing religions or God is considered a crime as well. When Alber was arrested, I remembered my friend Kareem Amer, a famous Egyptian blogger who was sentenced to 4 years in prison in 2007 for insulting Islam and the then current President Mubarak. Kareem suffered a great deal in prison. He was tortured several times, and spent a long time in solitary confinement under horrible conditions. Alber’s arrest also reminded me of myself. Since he was arrested I have started having flashbacks from the bad experiences I went through last year. I was imprisoned in Egypt for 10 months, because of other opinion laws such as Insulting the Military Institution. I also remembered how the corrupt police officers Sayyed Abdel-Kareem & Mohammed Abdel-Rahman at El-Marg prison wanted to file a case against me, during my imprisonment in December 2012, accusing me of insulting Islam. I remembered how they tried to use this new case as a form of blackmail to keep me quiet, so that I would not speak about the torture I faced in El-Marg prison. Alber is not the only opinion prisoner in Egypt accused of Criticizing Islam. There are at least four other opinion prisoners being held in Egypt charged with Criticizing Islam, and it is no surprise that all of them are Christians. It started last year with Ayman Youseef Mansour, a 22 year old blogger, who was sentenced on October 22, 2011 to 3 years of prison because of his writings criticizing Islam on his Facebook page. Egyptian courts later refused his appeal, denying him his right to reconsider the severity sentence. Ayman’s case was followed in January 2012 by the case of “Gamal Abdou Masoud”, a 17 year old from Asyut in Upper Egypt. Gamal was tagged on Facebook in a picture which criticized Islam. Angry mobs surrounded his house because of this picture, burned his house and the houses of other Christians in the village, and forced his family to leave the village. The police didn’t arrest anyone from these mobs. Instead, Gamal was sentenced to 3 years in prison for Insulting Islam. Then in April 2012, another Christian was imprisoned for Insulting Islam. Makarem Diab Said, a teacher who was also from Asyut, was sentenced to 6 years, just because he said some aggressive words against Islam when he was quarrelling with one of his colleagues at work. A few weeks ago, on September 12, 2012, a court in Sohag sentenced another Christian, Bishoy El-Beheri to 6 years in prison for Criticizing Islam and Criticizing President Mohammed Morsi. This case is very similar to Kareem’s. The only difference is that in Kareem’s case the punishment for criticizing President Mubarak was only one year in prison, but criticizing President Morsi now leads to 3 years in prison. Many others are in prison under the same accusation and more will surely follow. The General Egyptian Prosecutor has just sent a case against Google officials to the State Security Investigations department in Egypt, because Google didn’t block the movie The Innocence of Muslims from its search engine. Those activists suffer because Egypt doesn’t have an independent judiciary. Many cases take decades to go before the Egyptian court. But when the issue is political, they can finish the case in a few days, just as they finished my trial 12 days after my arrest in March 2011. They are now doing the same with Alber. Obviously there is a political reason for the Egyptian regime to jail Alber. They wish to intimidate Christians and make them leave the country. That is why Alber’s trial is being processed so fast. If there was proper international response, perhaps they would proceed with more caution. Alber is expected to be sentenced to 3 years imprisonment within a few weeks. There is campaign supporting his freedom on Facebook and Twitter, but there is not enough time for the campaign to gain enough traction. The worst part is that this phenomenon of jailing bloggers with the accusation of Insulting Religion is wide spread now in Muslim countries. In Saudi Arabia, young blogger Hamza Kashgari is now in jail, accused of blasphemy, and could face the death sentence. In Tunisia, there are many of bloggers now being jailed under the same accusations, such as the two Bloggers Jabeur Mejri and Ghazi Beji, who were sentenced on March 28, 2012 to 7 ½ years in prison. In Morocco, Mohammed Socrates is spending 2 years in jail because he is an atheist, but the authorities in Morocco were smart enough to accuse him of narcotics trafficking, and there is no need to say that he confessed under torture!!! Religion is just a collection of superstitions. I still can’t imagine that in the 21st century there are people going to prison because they do not believe that someone walked on water or a virgin gave birth to a child. There is no harm in criticizing religion. God doesn’t exist, and you can’t harm someone who doesn’t exist.

80,"Destroying the Fourth Reich","2012-10-07 00:00:00","Maikel Nabil",null,"Destroying the Fourth Reich >> 07 October 2012 #fullpost{display:inline;} It was 1952 when, three months before starting a coup in Egypt, the so called Moslem Soldiers changed their name to The Free Officers in order to conceal their strong ties tothe Moslem Brotherhood and its leader Hassan Al-Banna. Two important figures in this coup would subsequently become Presidents in the New Government: Gamal Abdel Nasser and Mohammed Anwar Al-Sadat. The latter explicitly admitted in front of the Egyptian Parliament that both of them cooperated with Hassan Al-Banna in the secret militia of the Moslem Brothers. It is well known that Hassan Al-Banna was keen on Nazism. During WWII he used the newspaper he had established “Al-Nazeer” as a tool for supporting the Nazi army. Such was his advocacy that he stated Adolf Hitler had converted to Islam and was supported by Allah. Additionally, he, Amin Al-Hussieni and their colleges cooperated with the Nazi Arabic radio which was covering the whole Middle East at that time spreading the Nazi ideology. Beyond the complexity of their political relations, Al-Sadat and Al-Banna shared an obscure affinity for Nazism. In his diaries “In Search of Identity” Al-Sadat admitted having contact with the Nazi Army in the prospect of cooperation during the WWII, when he was a young officer in the Egyptian Army, Even when this attitude is open to interpretation in the context of the Egyptian search for support against British domination. Later, Al-Sadat used a tie with the swastika during one of his negotiations with Israeli politicians. In October 1981 death found him wearing a uniform suspiciously similar to the one used by the “SS”. In the light of these precedents it is not surprising that in 1952 Nasser and Sadat had abolished the Egyptian Liberal democracy and started a new regime based on Social Nationalism, Xenophobia, and Anti-Semitism. The signification of symbolism should not be underestimated: the green Independence Egyptian flag was substituted by a new one exhibiting the 3 Nazi flag colors (Red, White, and Black). They spread their power to Sudan, Libya, Yemen, Tunisia, Syria, Iraq, and Gaza, and in every time carrying the same ideology and colors of the Nazi flag. After the end of WWII the world believed that Nazism had ended; they overlooked the establishment of a new Nazi regime in the Middle East. These officers, heirs of the Nazi ideology, started a 4th Reich in Egypt establishing characteristically oppressive institutions on the same attitude of the Gestapo and the SS. That’s why it wasn’t a surprise that the Nazi war criminal Aribert Heim was hiding in Egypt under cover for decades. In addition, they expelled 80 thousands of Egyptian Jews just after robbing their properties and removing their citizenship. Not being punished by this crime, 10 million Egyptian Christians are their new target. Disconcertingly, this Nazi regime is being supported now by Israel. Probably Ronald Regan was right when he said there is a great similarity between Politics and Prostitution. Following the teachings of Goebbels a huge propaganda system was assembled in Egypt and the Arab World in order to manipulate and mobilize the public opinion. Fully in function until now, its consequences have been witnessed by the whole world recently: a political and human crisis triggered by the American amateur movie Innocence of Moslems. Unfortunately, the Nazi legacy has been perpetuated in Egypt. Most of laws promulgated soon after the coup have not been touched till now. Personally, when jailed last year I was judged by laws made in the 1960s. The Military council ruling Egypt until last July didnt touch those laws, and Mohammed Morsi (the Moslem Brotherhood president) neither did. While you are reading this, Ayman Youssef Mansour, Gamal Abdou Masoud, Makarem Diab Said, Bishoy El-Beheri and many others are in Egyptian Jails because of criticizing Islam. The activist Alber Saber, currently tried due to the fact that he is atheist, could be the most recent case but wont be the last one as long as this Nazi regime remains in power. Not a few of us assume with unbelievable naivety that gone the bad leader, everything will be solved. That is a dangerous mistake. If the Nazi army had not been defeated, the Nazi regime would have lasted even after Hitler’s death. Similarly, a little changed in Egypt after the outset of Nasser, Sadat, Mubarak or Tantawi, the problem is in the regime, not in individuals. 4 months ago, I moved to Germany, trying to understand this European Ideology which infected my country, while Europe managed to get cured from it. By now the most significant fact I discovered is that many Germans fought against the Nazi regime from inside, and tragically all of them failed. The intervention of other countries was necessary to overthrow the Nazis. I suspect that the same goes with the Egyptian dictatorship. All the attempts to break it down from inside will fail, even revolutions won’t work. The disregard the world shows for Egypt dictatorship’s crimes gives room for its perpetuation. I hope the recent attacks on western embassies can serve in History as the attack on Pearl Harbor. The world has to know that if no one decided to face it, this dictatorship will remain, and will continue exporting hatred and terrorism to the whole world forever.

By KAREEM AMER, MAIKEL NABIL, AHMAD BATEBI, HADEEL KOUKI A ND AHED AL HENDI On Sunday, the Hirschhorn Museum in Washington, D.C., will open the first major American exhibition of art by Ai Weiwei, one of Chinas most famous dissidents. Among its works: an approximately 3-by-6-foot magnetic-resonance image of his brain bleeding from a police beating in 2009. Washington diplomats, journalists and art lovers will attend the exhibit before it moves to the Indianapolis Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum in New York and other major galleries. Yet one figure wont be able to attend the show: Ai Weiwei. The Chinese government has long denied Mr. Ai his human rights—imprisoning him, indicting him on trumped-up charges, and now confiscating his passport and denying his fundamental right to travel. In July, the Chaoyang District Court rejected Mr. Ais final appeal even as they forbade him from attending his own hearing. As online activists from the Middle East who have similarly been imprisoned for our words, we understand his fate all too well. Last year, Mr. Ai was detained for 81 days and forbidden to leave Beijing. The Chinese governments charges of tax fraud are intended to keep him intimidated. Today Mr. Ai seeks merely to travel, blog and speak freely. Chinese authorities refuse to return his passport unless he pledges not to leave the country. What are they afraid of? Why would such an all-powerful state fear the tweets and blog posts of a single man? Mr. Ai first rose to prominence through his art and architecture. Invited to blog by an Internet company in 2005, he initially hesitated. Once he started, however, his posts became increasingly bold. Authorities soon shut his blog down. I was very sad the moment they shut it off, because there was nothing we could do, Mr. Ai told Time magazine recently. And then some guy said, I opened a miniblog for you. It was just one sentence—140 characters. Twitter was like a poem. It was rich, real and spontaneous. It really fit my style. Within a year and a half, Mr. Ai had sent out 60,000 tweets, spending a minimum of eight hours a day on the social-media site. His first blog post was one line: To express yourself needs a reason, but expressing yourself is the reason. Chinas repression of Mr. Ai confirms the insecurity that lies at the heart of the Communist regime—an insecurity based on the fear that criticism will unmask the regimes illegitimacy. This fear has plagued all too many governments elsewhere, including in the Middle East. In dictatorial regimes, publicizing the plight of individuals whose rights are ignored takes on political and symbolic importance. As Mr. Ai put it, regarding poorly built school buildings toppled by a 2008 earthquake: I always focus on individual cases. How many students died? What are their names? What are the basic facts? . . . Can a human being speak out with dignity? Mr. Ai is now famous, but countless Chinese who suffer daily arent. Their stories are no less important, and it is people like Mr. Ai who give us a glimpse into their world. How many Chinese citizens censor themselves even before the authorities can? As in the Middle East, many are afraid to voice their true opinions. They engage in doublethink, outwardly expressing support for a regime while silently cursing it. As Mr. Ai correctly observed, Words can be deleted, but the facts wont be deleted with them. In 2009, Mr. Ai was nearly beaten to death while trying to show solidarity with another Chinese dissident, Tan Zuoren, by attending his trial. Now it is our turn to stand up for Mr. Ai. Our jailers—in Egypt, Iran and Syria—believed they were stronger than us. We stand as a testament to the indomitable power of freedom to overcome tyranny. Dictatorships are inherently unstable. The world must know this. Mr. Ai has said, Once youve tasted freedom, it stays in your heart and no one can take it. Then, you can be more powerful than a whole country. We agree. All of us have tasted freedom—but have also spent a combined 15 years in prison for voicing dissent. Today, although he is denied his basic human rights, Mr. Ai is more powerful than ever. It is the moral duty of all people to stand in solidarity with Ai Weiwei. His fate and Chinas future are one. Messrs. Amer and Nabil are Egyptian. Mr. Batebi is Iranian. Ms. Kouki and Mr. Al Hendi are Syrian. All have been imprisoned in their home countries for political activism. They are board members of CyberDissidents.org, part of the New York-based organization Advancing Human Rights.

It freed all the terrorists who had committed violence against Jews before the coup, and jailed liberals and seculars instead. It encouraged aggression toward the Egyptian Jewish minority, which led to new terrorist attacks against Jewish individuals and properties in Egypt. Between 1954 and 1956, 80,000 Egyptian Jews were expelled from Egypt, but not before they were robbed of their property. After that, Egypt revoked their citizenship, forbidding them from returning to their homeland. Of course, before they left, Egyptian authorities forced them to sign papers saying that they had been treated fairly and were leaving of their own will. There are currently around 300 Jews living in Egypt, isolated in an environment that is hostile to them. The Christian minority in Egypt (known as Copts) reacted in a very selfish way at the time, choosing not to interfere in the crisis so as to avoid any harm. They thought that if they took the side of the dictatorship, they would be safe. Obviously, it didn’t work. After the Egyptian military expelled Jews and outlawed Bahais and Shias, they started their campaign against Christians. The Egyptian regime has maintained since that time a very fundamental understanding of Islam, and forced it through the media and the education system. Violent attacks against Christians became increasingly frequent, and most of the time no one was prosecuted. The Egyptian regime created an uncomfortable situation for Christians in order to force them to leave the country. And the evidence shows that it worked. Some 4 million Egyptian Christians have emigrated from Egypt over the last 60 years, representing one-third of the entire Coptic population, and comprising nearly 75% of Egyptians living abroad. But Egyptian authorities are not satisfied with that. After Mohammed Morsi acceded to power, he decided to speed up this process. The Egyptian regime used the film “Innocence of Muslims” to start a huge propaganda campaign against Egyptian Christians. The whole propaganda in Egyptian media was saying that this movie was made by Egyptian Christians who are living abroad, while it’s not. Al-Azhar, 6 April youth, and other institutions in Egypt which have strong ties with the Egyptian Intelligence issued lots of statements against the movie. And all of them repeated the same lie that this movie was created by Egyptian Christians. They even used a Christian man living in USA, who works also for the Egyptian Intelligence. He kept saying in the media that he produced the movie, while obviously he didn’t. And of course, Christians in Egypt are becoming increasingly isolated under this propaganda. Violence against Christians occurs every day, and the state usually takes the side of the Muslim murderers. It isn’t inconceivable that as a way of protecting this operation, the Egyptian state sponsored the attacks on foreign embassies. A group of poor thugs were paid and led to the American Embassy in Cairo to attack it, while they didn’t know where they were, or why they were there. Similar attacks occurred in other countries in which the Egyptian Intelligence has power. Not a single attack on a foreign embassy occurred outside the sphere of Egyptian influence, or what we call what we call “Daughters of July State”, referring to the coup of July 1952. But Western countries cared more about their own interests in Muslim countries, and as usual surrendered to the racist blackmail of the Egyptian regime. The Egyptian state is also excessively using the laws forbidding criticism of Islam. At least five Christians are now imprisoned in Egypt under the accusation of “insulting Islam.” Ayman Youssef Mansour, a 22-year-old blogger, was sentenced in October 2011 to three years because of",4106,6,0,7,NULL,http://www.maikelnabil.com/2012/09/will-egypts-christians-face-same-fate.html,47,null,US,-0.334375,English,11,"2020-07-21 12:30:00"
83,"Egypt & Israel: A New Treaty Is Needed","2012-09-06 00:00:00","Maikel Nabil",null,"Egypt & Israel: A New Treaty Is Needed >> 06 September 2012 #fullpost{display:inline;} One of the things I hate about the marriage institution is that the rules (the contract) are decided only one time, and can’t be updated again. I think it’s irrational, because life is a dynamic environment. Everything and everyone change all the time. you, me and them. So, how you can make fixed rules for changing things? How you can sign some rules when you are 25, and expect that you will like these rules after 30 years when you will be 55? I believe humans should be able to update the rules every day. This will make their relations more healthy and successful. The same works in politics. Nations shouldn’t have fixed contracts for their relations with each other. Look at France and Germany after the World War 2 as an example. They are updating the rules every day from the European Economic Area to the EU, to the NATO …etc. Every year there is a new update in the rules of the relation between both countries. That’s why they are acting as perfect allies, and there is no fear on collapsing the peace status between both of them. That’s why I don’t like the Egyptian-Israeli Peace treaty anymore. It’s a 70s model of contracts which can’t work anymore in the 21 century. It became just a piece of paper which can’t protect the peace status any more. It’s a fixed contract, meant to be a beginning in 1979, but no one cared to update this contract. And the sad fact is that both countries can’t live with this contract any more. Now the treaty is going in one of two directions: either to be updated or to fall! Egypt, double-Face Authorities oppressing moral people Double-Face Authorities After some Egyptian military officers killed the former president Mohammed Anwar Al-Sadat in 1981, Egyptian Authorities don’t consider 1979’s treaty as a peace treaty any more. For them, it’s a seize-fire deal. Al-Sadat wanted a real peace, but they don’t. They are still dreaming in making revenge for their successive loses in previous wars against Israel. After 33 years of the peace treaty, Israel still doesn’t exist on official Egyptian maps. When young Egyptian students study geography, they find only Palestine on their State-Printed books. Well, Israelis don’t exist. Or at least don’t have the right to exist! Egypt also haven’t canceled a law was made before the peace treaty which criminalizing Zionism, and punishing any Egyptian Zionist by removing his citizenship. Mubarak, who was called “A friend of Israel” by lots of Israeli leaders, was in power for 3 decades, and never tried to drop this law. And when revolutionaries invaded State Security Investigation offices in February 2011, they found a department there under the name of “Countering Zionism”. The funny thing is that Egyptian authorities never made a definition of Zionism. So, calling for peace could be a crime if the authorities wanted, just as they banned “Jehovah’s Witness” in Egypt for their support to peace and co-existence. For Egyptian Authorities, It’s just a piece of Paper. They are still training young officers that Israel is their only enemy, and forcing young recruits to say every day that “Jews are enemies of Allah”. Egypt haven’t opened Academic center in Israel according to the treaty. Egyptians have to take permission from “The Egyptian Military Intelligence” if they wanted to visit Israel. State syndicates still refuse any kind of normalization with Israel. The State-Owned media still run the Anti-Israel propaganda. It was an ex-military officer (not a revolutionary) who said in 2010 that Israel send sharks to Sharm El-Shikh to attack tourists and tourism. Egyptian Intelligence agencies target Egyptian peace activists and call them Israeli spies, exactly like what they did to me. Never mention facilitating invading the Israeli Embassy, and terrorist attacks on Israeli borders. Moral People On the other hand, the Egyptian people feel deceived. They know that the peace treaty was built on 2 bases: Giving Sinai back to Egypt, and making a progress forward in the Palestinian-Israeli peace process. The first base is not going well while some Israeli Politicians speak about reoccupying Sinai, or giving it to Palestinians. You can’t trust someone who is talking about re-invading your country for the third time, and gets elected and participates in the government. And the other base, there is no progress in the peace talks with Palestinians. It was going good until Oslo 1993, and then everything stopped. After Ariel Sharon left the cabinet, Peace with Palestinians is not any more on the agenda of Israeli governments. The point is thatthe peace treaty was meant to make Israel coexist in Middle East as Egypt, not to Make Egypt isolated in the area as Israel. Egyptians are not Anti-Semitic people; they are just moral people who can’t stop themselves from caring about Palestinians who suffer from occupation and building new settlements on their land. My people feels deceived when an Israeli leader speak about annexing the west bank to Israel, or about living with the conflict forever, even while we had a perfect Palestinian leader who truly believes in peace and the right of Israel to exist. The way that Netanyahu speaks about Abu Mazen is completely humiliating in a way never used in diplomatic medium. This wasn’t our deal. And calling for ending the Palestinian suffering of course couldn’t be considered anti-Semitism or even Anti-Israel speech. It’s Israel which risks the peace treaty when it ignores Palestinian rights, not Egyptians when being pro-Palestinians. Israel, Uncaring leaders ruling scared people Uncaring Leaders Well, even Israel is a democracy, but strangely it acts in the same manner as Egypt. In Israel also there is a gap between reactions of politicians and normal citizens. Israeli leaders don’t care about building peace relation with Egyptians. The Israeli Embassy in Egypt doesn’t have a website. The Israeli Academic Centre in Egypt don’t have Arabic page, and the English page don’t include contacts. I had to use the Hebrew page to get information about this socially-inactive hole. After all these years no leadership in Israel (rightwing or leftwing) cared to open a website for the Israeli Embassy in Cairo, or to have Arabic information for Egyptians about the Israeli mission on their land. The Israeli Embassy in Egypt acts as if their job to maintain good relation with the Egyptian dictatorship, not the Egyptian people. They never invited peace activists to their events, Just Egyptian officials. They are more loyal to the Egyptian military more than Egyptian young military officers. I questioned myself to which side these guys belong after a senior official in the Israeli Embassy in Cairo asked me if I have permission from the Egyptian Intelligence when I wanted to get a visa to Israel. Israeli leaders don’t even care about Egypt violations to the peace treaty. They never complain. They never complained about Egyptian security orders to arrest any Egyptian who enters the Israeli Embassy. They never complained about Egypt blocking official Israeli internet websites including sites of the Israeli president, the prime minister, the ministry of foreign affairs and others. They never complained about targeting Egyptian Peace activists. They never complained about Egypt arrest to normal Egyptian citizens and accusing them of treason because of having a mobile number of an Israeli citizen saved on their mobile phones. And instead of complaining about Egypt violations to the peace treaty, Israel is defending Human Rights violations in front of the UNHRC, and packing the Egyptian dictatorship in USA. Maybe they don’t care. Maybe they enjoy being a victim, and maybe something else. The Egyptian Intelligence arrested me 3 days after I said that the Netanyahu government is scaring Israelis to push Israelis to vote for the security agenda of right-wing parties. A year later, former MOSSAD and Schin-Bet leaders spoke out against the policy of Netanyahu toward Iran, accused his government of using scare tactics toward the Israeli public, and said that Iran threat is exaggerated. Maybe some politicians want Egypt to be a permanent risk on Israel, to use the public fear for their own interest. Maybe! Scared People Israelis remind me with the Christian minority in Egypt. In Egypt lots of groups scare Christians; Salafis, Moslem Brothers, Military Authorities, Churches, Holy books, even Christian human rights activists. All of these groups use scare tactics to push Christians in the direction they want them to go. As a former Christian, I couldn’t stop being a reaction, and start to be an action, except when I decided not to put fears in consideration. I don’t let fears affect my decisions. That’s why I don’t react to scare tactics. The same happens with Israelis, every one scares them. Israelis are nearly the most scared people on Earth. They are scared from Iran, Hamas, Hezbollah, Al-Qaeda, Israeli Arabs, the Arabic Spring, Nazis, Arab League, Anti-Zionist Jews, etc. Even Israeli politicians and peace activists use scare as a way to motivate Israelis. That’s why Israeli elections usually mirror reactions not demands of Israelis. Even the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty was a reaction to Al-Sadat initiative, not an Israeli initiative. I understand how difficult it’s to be an Israeli. I understand how it’s when you live in a part of the world which praises Hitler and considers another holocaust against Jews is a good step forward to the resurrection day. I understand how it’s to send your kids to a school knowing that this school could be bombed by a terrorist, and his people will call him a martyr. But still, being a reaction converts you into a tool in the hand of the one made the action. Your enemy calculates your reaction before making his action. And most of these scary groups don’t deserve such attention; The Iranian regime is falling from inside, Hamas which don’t even have aircraft won’t throw Israel in the sea, The Moslem Brothers in Egypt turned to be copies from Mubarak, there will be no holocaust in the 21 century. A Jewish friend once told me when I was criticizing Israel foreign policies “When my government fails in something, I have to do it myself”, and I believe this is the right thing to do now, after I experienced myself the un-functionality of Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs. I believe Israelis need to stop being a reaction to anyone. They should decide what the right thing to do, and do it without thinking of the sequences. If Israelis had stood beside Arabic revolutions, it would have been the best thing happened to Israel ever in recent history. Menachem Begin in 1977 didn’t trust Al-Sadat and wanted to make him leave Israel in the first day of his visit, but it was the Israeli peace groups which made this peace works. I believe Israelis and Egyptians shouldn’t wait their leaders to make a progress. I didn’t wait my government. The society has to push politicians, not the opposite. Israelis have to vote for politicians based on political agenda, not based on fears. What’s the idea for a security agenda government, while this government apologized to Egypt after Egyptian authorities facilitated a terrorist attack on Israel? Initiatives for a new treaty with Egypt should start from the ground. Israelis shouldn’t wait until the treaty falls, and then forced to make a reaction again. Final Words Israel had a peace agreement with Egypt in 1956, and the cold peace lasted at that time for 11 years. But because it was an agreement with the Egyptian authority not Egyptian people, this agreement fall in a couple of weeks in 1967. The same can happen with 1979’s treaty. A piece of paper wouldn’t protect the status of peace between the two nations. 1979’s treaty will fall anyway. So, it’s either making a new treaty now, or facing the sequences of falling of the peace treaty while we don’t have another alternative.

What hurt the most? … No, not the time I’ve tried to slit my wrists with a piece of glass and couldn’t because it wasn’t sharp enough… and wasn’t the night I spent at the same place where they told me that the disappeared journalist Reda Hilal was assassinated… not also that time where I was physically assaulted by a police officer and the sanctity of my body was violated… and it also wasn’t those moments when they made me watch them torture the other inmates at ElMarg prison facility…. Not the moments when the ElMarg police officers where framing me for religious contempt and blackmailing me to stay silent about their violations against me… and not the moments I was so close to death during my hunger strike, not the moments when I forgot the names of my friends nor the moments when I started to lose my vision, nor the moments following me waking up and not realizing where I was, not the moment when I refused to write an apology that would set me free and chose to return to prison with my own free will, it wasn’t the moments I cried for my dear friend Nour Moreb the loyal friend who made sure before he committed suicide to make my picture as his Facebook profile picture so as to expose the silence of the world on my incarceration, no all those moments were hard, but they weren’t the hardest. The hardest moment was when I was stepping in the military court from the transportation vehicles while on hunger strike shouting out with the down fall of the military ruling while seeing only two people standing before the court, my father and a friend!!! … or when I was standing alone in the court room before the judge without lawyers present, while tens of lawyers were in the adjacent hall. How many times have I asked to be visited by a human rights lawyer so that he would put an end for the violations happening against me in jail? But not one human rights organization responded to my pleas, and if it weren’t for Amir Salem, the brave lawyer, who helped me transfer by the end of December out of ElMarg prison facility, I might’ve been killed there as a result of mistreatment inside. It was hard when one of the rebels told me about a meeting he had with some of the members of the S.C.A.F. on February 2011, and how he told them that he was my friend though he didn’t approve of the offences that I directed to the armed forces… the funny thing was that this person regretted it and told me about what happened, but how many others did the same thing and never said a word? ... The rebels were the ones who gave the green light for the army to imprison me. The crisis of the Egyptian revolution The Egyptian revolution missed the presence of a compass… the rebels are moved by their temperaments and the flow of inclination, the don’t know what their goals are or what they want… they went out on their way to bring down the regime, then gave the power to the army of that regime, and surrendered the parliament to the religious wing of the regime, then handed the leadership of the revolution to the general intelligence agents… they were fascinated and fooled by media and cable show stars while blinded to the dirty prison uniforms… searching for a hero to free them while oblivious to the freedom existing within them, looking for a just ruler among a bunch of thieves… listening to populists and demagogues while not reading for philosophers and intellectuals … they pursue those of gossip rather than those of understanding … a nation that does not read, as if knowledge was a vice, they put ideological barriers between them and the key to their revolution’s success, the move with the herd, not the herd of the “sofa party”, but the herd of the revolution’s party without asking about the intentions of the alpha male leading this herd!!! Some might see me as conceited for saying this (and they are free to do so) but I assume that I would’ve made a difference in the fate of this revolution, I might’ve saved a lot of lives and eyes, I might’ve shrunk the lifespan of the July military regime, I would’ve helped in the victory of this revolution during its early months… the members of the military council knew that well, that’s why they started with the procedures of my case since the 2nd week of them assuming power (and perhaps the 1st week) And for those who wonder about the abilities I claim to have, they are simply the same points I’ve been attacked on: being atheist, my foreign relations my position concerning Israel… the world doesn’t feel that I’m odd or different or eastern… my position regarding Israel assures everybody that I don’t hate anybody based on their beliefs, that I will not cause a new war in the region … my position on religion removes any doubt regarding any relation between me and extremists groups, and at the same time confirms my commitment to rational analysis and reasonable thinking… during my conversations with foreign diplomats the conversation always is very straightforward, and a lot do those diplomats admit their fault without shame just because they think I’m not a stranger. I would have used that so we could stop the arms deals that is constantly supplied to the military council, and save the lives and eyes of the rebels, this could’ve also been invested to apply pressure to the council to hand over the power during only six months. The Egyptian government to accept the Rome convention , and other international human rights treaties, the council would’ve been forced to organize a free election, and to hold just courts for all the corrupts of the July system… But all this never happened simply because the revolutionary bodies put their hate for Israel before their love for their country, and delivered me on a silver platter to the militaries … I believe that it was the rebels were the ones who imprisoned me not the militaries, I’ve been tried and imprisoned really early during the revolution, at a time were the rebels were influential, and if they’ve taken the same reaction they did when Asmaa Mahfouz and Reem Maged and others later on, I wouldn’t have been imprisoned in the first place. A Predicament On the night before I was supposed to travel to Germany to study (not to immigrate) a friend from the group who were involved in the campaign demanding my freedom, she wrote: “I would’ve understood the decision of immigration if you hadn’t called for, and were involved in the revolution, but since you have done that especially since you are an activist, and went and did something controversial and left your friends in a tight spot defending you and ditched us, then _l_ Pic 2 of 7: I would’ve understood the decision of your immigration if you hadn’t called for, and were involved in the revolution, but since you have done that especially since you are an activist, and went and did something controversial and left your friends in a tight spot defending you and ditched us, then _l_ The real crises with the mindset of the Egyptian people is that they consider defending opinion prisoners as a tight spot or a predicament, it’s not just that we blame the victim and disregard executioner, but we also blame those whoever tries to help this victim… I’ve never heard of an African American accusing Martin Luther King that he “stuck the black community with defending him” nor have I ever read about any African accusing Nelson Mandela that he has “set” them “up” for defending him for 38 years straight, and up till now it never happened that someone from Burma said that Aung San Su kyi has “set” the Burmese opposition “up” with defending her!!!… In Egypt we consider human rights defenders are “sticking us with their defense” when they defend our rights!!! Last month some closely connected people with the Egyptian General Intelligence administration evoked a campaign against me as a result of my position from terrorism. And here I’m not talking about the flow of swearing or provoking of violence, but also encouraging the army to imprison me all over again. And of course I’m not talking about a difference in opinion, although the justification of a terrorist operation is not an opinion… but I’m talking about a new tone here, which is them gloating with the fact that they have defended me when I was incarcerated. great number of brutes who didn’t read my writings which they curse me for, say that they regret participating in the marches of my release… when the defense of free speech becomes something you regret, then don’t mind the military shoes diving in your gut, let he who has sown the thorns reap it… the person who says “cursed be the principles that would make me defend Maikel” is someone who has never believed a day in those principles … and the girl who says, “damned be the revolution that would make me defend Maikel Nabil” is a human who never believed a day in the revolution. Sometimes I find myself thinking: what did I earn when I entangled myself with 10 months of imprisonment for defending the right s of people whom I don’t know? What would I get out of defending the rights of young men refusing compulsory military recruitment although I’ve been irrevocably exempted? … did you know that Ahmed Mustafa, the first blogger to be military tried in Egypt (year 2010) is almost the only prisoner that I’ve defended during his incarceration, and hasn’t humiliate me after his release like the others?... every time I answer myself with the same replies, I did what my conscience command me to and what retains my self-respect… but the most important question that I couldn’t answer: am I prepared to give up my freedom yet again defending a group of people who consider me defending their rights a “predicament”?? The question I keep asking myself constantly” who has the right to gloat the other? … I was invited to the meeting with Omar Suleiman on February 2011, and I didn’t go, while Mustafa EL-Naggar and the Muslim Brotherhood went, and you have elected them for the parliament … I’ve been locked away and tortured in the military intelligence on February the 4th, you held your silence and followed Wael Ghoniem arriving in Hossam Badrawee’s, the secretary general of the National Democratic Party, car saying that the intelligence officers who arbitrary detained him, are in fact loyal and patriot men… you praised the army and ignored me during the time when the rebels were tortured and killed in the military camps… you want to hold the Salafis accountable for voting “yes” for the referendums on modifications of the constitution, and you don’t hold “6th of April” accountable for giving legitimacy to the military council after the coup on Mubarak … you consider Khalid Ali a candidate of the revolution although he accepted the negotiations with the Egyptian General Intelligence administration with no known results for this negotiations, and he has participated in a charade of falsified elections that gave legitimacy for the continued presence of the military ruling, and you consider me non representative of the revolution though I’ve refused the invitation to meet one of the military council members, and before that I refused to receive a phone call from the prime minister Al-Ganzoury, and before that I refused a position in Egyptian ministry of foreign affairs, so now talk to me about being revolutionary.

85,"The Generals Message","2012-03-20 00:00:00","Maikel Nabil",null,"The Generals Message >> 20 March 2012 #fullpost{display:inline;} I was wearing the blue clothes of prison that day, transformed with cuffed hands to the military court, and after the legal procedures of my trial which I boycotted I met that general. He started his talking saying “Last week I was in a military meeting in USA, and I met X & Y from the Pentagon, bla bla bla “. It wasn’t hard for me to understand his message; he was telling me that America on his side, while I’m “the Liberal Democratic activist” is suffering in Jail. For more than 6 years I’ve been acting in Egypt for Democracy, individual freedoms, human rights, Peace and against Racism, Wars, Militarism, and Discrimination. And for this, I was arrested 5 times in Egypt, was beaten and sexually harassed. The military invaded my house twice, persecuted even the girl they thought she was my girlfriend. I’ve spent 10 months during the last year in Egyptian prisons with a hunger strike lasted for 130 days, after they accused me in front of a military tribunal of “insulting the military”. My family and friends were targeted by the military, and my father was moved from his job 4 times the last year to harm my financial status. And after thousands of activists around the world suffered to get me out of prison, the military released me without dropping the charges, meaning that they can get me back to prison at any time. Neither me nor any other revolutionary in Egypt thought that our revolution could be transformed to this militarized nightmare. We rose against Mubarak aiming to live in a free country, calling for democratic reform, Pressuring for protecting the Human rights and the dignity of our citizens. But instead of that we were killed, injured, military tried, tortured, arbitrary detained, and targeted in local media. And for the surprise of us, the Egyptian military is backed up by the free world, and making these violations under the protection of the USA. During my imprisonment, I knew about the Statements issued by US leaders condemning my detention. I even read the letters which Senator Mark Kirk and Representative Frank Wolf sent to Me and to Field Marshal Hussien Tantawi… but every day I was asking myself, what I’m benefiting from these vocal statements while I’m in Jail and the Egyptian Army is oppressing my people with the American weapons? During the last year, I was following the file of American hostages in Egypt. It began with Ilan Grabel, The American-Israeli citizen who was arrested in Egypt for no crime, just to be traded for something we don’t know till now. And because the free world accepted to be blackmailed, and because the Egyptian military benefited from blackmailing USA & Israel, they repeated it again, but this time with more than 20 American citizens in the ridiculous case against civil society organizations in Egypt. These Americans were prohibited from leaving Egypt for a long time, and targeted by state-owned media in Egypt with a military anti-American propaganda including great dose of conspiracy theory and Anti-Semitism. After the Egyptian Military knew that the military aids to Egypt won’t be decreased in the next year, they allowed these Hostages to leave Egypt without dropping the case, and asking them to be back in 2 weeks to continue their trial procedures. It was leaked also that SCAF members were using the American hostages as a tool to free the Egyptian Terrorist Omar Abdel-Rahman, an information which opens lots of questions related to international terrorism and the Anti-American groups in Egypt. And after that the pro-SCAF activist Tawfeek Okasha led a demonstration in front of the American Embassy in Cairo, and the revolutionaries feared that his thugs could invade the Embassy as what happened before in the Israeli Embassy and tried to make them leave the area, but the American-backed Egyptian military attacked these revolutionaries!!! Last week, I was in Geneva to Testify in front of the UN Human rights council, asking the council when they will act to make sure that the Universal Declaration for Human Rights and the International Convention for Civil and Politic rights is respected. And this week I’m here in USA, to ask the American leaders if the American Tax-Payers are cutting from their money to support dictatorships? Why the Egyptian people aren’t allowed to have the same rights and freedoms which the American people have? How a democratic country gives weapons to such Nazi militarists knowing that they will use it against democratic activists? How would you expect that Egyptians will consider USA a friendly country if our brothers are killed by the American weapons? And if the military aids given to Egypt is to support the cold peace between Egypt and Israel, then why Egypt didn’t stop targeting Peace activists? And why Egypt didn’t stop the Anti-Israel propaganda?

86,"In which side is Israel standing?","2011-03-25 00:00:00","Maikel Nabil",null,"In which side is Israel standing? >> 25 March 2011 #fullpost{display:inline;} Mistaken Mistaken whoever believes that in politics, borders can isolate nations. What happened in Tunisia resulted in Mubaraks end in Cairo, what happens in Syria & Iran decides who will lead the Knesset in Israel, and whats said in Tel-Aviv decides what USA will make in Middle East. But obviously, this rule isnt liked by those who are saying that Israel doesn’t have any other choice except to wait and see who will reach power in Egypt: Liberals or Islamists? ... Or in other words, they are saying: Dont blame us when it goes bad in Cairo, because we don’t have anything to do with it… But Don’t they? Israel & Security Security in any nation is the most important thing to take care of. Thats why nations are having armies and police forces. But Israel maybe the only country in the world, in which security agenda decides who will be the Prime Minister. So, if the Anti-Israel states in Middle East decided to change their position and take the side of peace, those who are slaying peace for security in Israel wont be in the Knesset again. Thats why some leaders in Israel are grateful to Hamas and Iran for leading them to their positions in the Knesset. But dont forget Israeli friends, You have to live in Panic fearing from the monsters and aliens surrounding you in Middle East, or else how would they talk about the security anymore ? Me & Israel On December 2010, I declared that I want to visit Israel (for 2 weeks), to build bridges with Israeli activists, in order to help both nations in managing relations in a better way. For the last 4 months, Israeli officials are refusing to give me a visa to Israel. And more than 10 activists in Israel is trying to get me one, and all of them failed, even knowing that they represent several Israeli Institutions, and one of them is an active member in a party ruled Israel in the past. Actually, I started to believe that Mubarak who killed Israelis in Sinai (In 1973) is more welcomed in Israel than me the pacifist who refused to carry a weapon against Israel (could have been jailed because of that). Israel wouldnt refuse to give Mubarak a visa. So, the lesson which Israel wants me to learn, that I have to be an enemy of Israel to be welcomed in Israel, Just as the terrorists whom Israel speaks with in claimed peace talks, and yet there are people asking: Why those talks usually fail? Whats happening In Cairo? Every week, one of Israeli politicians visits Egypt. But they meet only Egyptian Militarists. They dont meet Egyptian liberal secular pro-peace activists. But here is the good news: Militarists here are giving the rule of Egypt to Islamists, and if we didnt stop this we will have an Islamic parliament in Egypt by next September. So if Israel is supporting Egyptian Militarists, and those militarists are supporting Islamists, Then Israel is supporting Islamists. That’s why I’m asking: In which side is Israel standing? Because obviously it isn’t the civil side. Egyptian Militarists are ensuring that they will keep the peace treaty, just as they were ensuring that Mubarak wont fail. And look at it from the other side, Has Iran or Turkey declared War against Israel? There are a big distance between declaring war and supporting terrorism. And if Egyptian officials had put a bomb in a church in Alexandria to kill their own citizens, so sure Israel can trust that those guys wont support terrorism in Israel. And you already know from Wikileaks that Tantawi was training his army for the last 20 years on the bases that Israel is the only enemy, so what a friend do you have. Too late understanding In 4 February, I published a video on the web, advising Israel to support the Egyptian revolution, to win the hearts of Egyptians, and it was broadcast on Israeli TV during following days. Lots of Israelis made fun of me, declaring their support to Mubarak. In the 3rd of March, the Arabic official site of the Israeli Ministry of foreign Affairs (Al-Tawasol) published Statements of some Israeli leaders showing solidarity with pro-democratic movements in Middle East, but it was too late. Egyptians dont care about what Israeli leaders would say, after they said that Mubarak is a friend of Israel... Israelis dont understand why Egyptians are angry of those words. Just Imagine that Im saying that Hitler is a friend of Egypt... bad words, isn’t it? Israeli activist, Roy Arad wrote about how Israeli police fined him when he and his friends converted Magen David square in Israel to another Tahrir square, to show solidarity with the Egyptian revolution. What a nice message to send to Egyptians, and we expect Egyptians to love Israel? Final Words - If Islamists took over Egypt, I can book the first plane ticket out of Egypt, and continue my life happily in any free country in the World. Im sure that lots of nations would be happy to accept me in their lands. But would you, Israeli people (the 8 millions), do the same? - Why Im writing this? … Because of what I said in the first paragraph: Whats happening in Jerusalem decides what will happen in Egypt, and I love my country. * Two Israeli newspapers refused publishing this article!!!!

On the 11th of February 2011, after the President’s stepping down speech that was delivered by Omar Suliman (Vice-President of the Republic, and the former head of the Egyptian intelligence), many Egyptian powers rushed into declaring the victory and the end of the revolution…. I regret having to say the following, mostly because that many of them are my friends, but the people have the right to know the truth… Some of them wanted to take advantage of the presence of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces to get some political positions by making deals with the Supreme council. They knew that they cannot achieve such positions through regular democratic process…. And some of them had connections with the secret service before the revolution was declared and supported the secret service institution per default (I don’t want to describe them as Secret Service’s agents) and some others thought that the army was not a part of the July Military Regime!!! And therefore was misled by the Army declarations (Press Releases) and have accepted the Army’s role in the transitional Phase. In fact the revolution has so far managed to get rid of the dictator but not of the dictatorship. A broad sector of Egyptian political Elite and rebels share this same vision with me. One of them is Dr. ElBaradei who mentioned in his article concerning the current situation in Egypt: “The army is leading the transitional phase in a mysterious and monopolizing way”. Many rebels continued to protest against the armed forces’ will calling for a civilian council instead of Supreme Council of the Armed forces. As I participated in the revolution since day one, I’ve witnessed the majority of the events. In the following study I will present all the evidences and documents which prove that the army did not stand by the people’s side, not even once during this revolution and that the army’s conduct was deceptive all the time and that it was protecting its own interests. In order to simplify this study, I’ve divided the Egyptian revolution into three stages that describe the army’s position: The first stage: Before Saturday, January 29, 2011 (i.e. before the army taking over the street) The second stage: From January 29 until the stepping down speech in February 11, 2011 (14 days) The third stage: After the stepping down speech (Since February 12 until now) The first stage: Before Saturday, January 29, 2011 (i.e. before the army taking over the street) The Egyptian revolution started in 25 January, 2011 and hundreds of thousands of Egyptians took the streets during the first four days of the revolution, the police forces faced them with brutality and killed more than 500 protestors and injured more than 6000 in addition to 1000 missing (turned out later that they are behind bars in the ministry of interior), so what was the reaction of the army? 1- Sami Annan, the Chief of Staff of the Egyptian army assured the United States of America that the Egyptian army is loyal to Mubarak and that it would not abandon Mubarak in contrary to what the Tunisian Army did. In its report about the Egyptian revolution, on January 25, 2011, the American news website “Startfor” (that is specialized in Intelligence reports) said: “it’s very little coincidence that the Egyptian army chief of staff is in Washington right now, with the U.S. getting assurances from the Egyptian army that the army will not abandon Mubarak like the Tunisian army did with Ben Ali.” « Startfor » did not name the Chief of Staff in its report and therefore we did not get any confirmation that the person “Startfor” mentioned was “Sami Anan”… until the daily “Al-Masry Al-Youm”, mentioned on January 30, 2011 that the Chief Of Staff of the Egyptian Army Sami Annan came back today from the United States of America. * Startfor changed the data after I published the Arabic copy of this research. It was written “it’s not a coincidence”, and they changed it into “it’s very little coincidence” …. So who is very powerful to make Startfor change a topic written from 40 days? … Sadly, I didn’t take a print screen of the Startfor topic before change. 2- The army provides the police with live bullets to kill the demonstrators on January 28 On January 28, 2011, hundreds of thousands of Egyptians took the streets to the Tahrir Square, after Friday prayers. The police confronted them with tear gas and smoke bombs as well as rubber and live bullets ... The battle between demonstrators in the Tahrir Square and the police forces last around 10 hours (from 2 pm until about midnight) ... Friday’s evening after six o’clock, the police forces stationed next to the parliament councils stopped the shooting for they ran out of ammunition. after few minutes, the protesters saw military policy Jeeps passing through them and heading towards the sieged police forces and then returned again… and after the departure of military police Jeeps, the police forces started firing live bullets at the demonstrators until they ran out of ammunition again… and this is how the same scene was repeated with Military police jeeps passing through demonstrators to provide live ammunition to the police so they start firing again… and at that point the demonstrators realized that the army is not on their side so theyve set on fire two jeeps belonging to the military police and an armored vehicle belonging to the Armored Corps, and captured four tanks. The second stage: From January 29 until the stepping down speech in February 11, 2011 (14 days) Since the early hours of Saturday 29th of January 2011, and after the demonstrators detained some of the army tanks and burnt the armors, the armed forces realized that they will not bear fighting the Egyptian revolutionaries … this is when the armed forces started to change the tone with the demonstrators. The army officers started speaking to the demonstrators, calming them, pacifying them. Hence, a new phase of the relation between the revolutionaries and the army started not based on direct clashes, but it was based on managing the conflict through indirect mechanisms such as: 1- Blockade of the revolutionaries and preventing the demonstrations from leaving El-Tahrir square in the first few days, especially towards the direction of the ministry of Interior and the Parliament councils … however, things got out of control the last three days of Mubaraks rule before his resignation, and thats when the army accepted the de facto of the demonstrators marching from the square, based on its policy of not having a direct clash with the revolutionaries. 2- The continuous threat of using the force: - On the 30th of January, the army tried –for no reason- to let-in a fire car into El-Tahrir square. The demonstrators thought it was going to be used for dispersing them with water splashes, thus they stopped it. That was when the army officer inside the fire car shot twice in the air to terrorize the demonstrators. - The same attitude happened on the 25th of February when a senior officer threatened one of the demonstrators saying: I will kill you. 3- Passive neutrality: The army has launched many statements claiming that it will protect the protestors; however the role of the army didnt continue behind launching statements. After the second speech of Mubarak at the night of Tuesday February the 1st, huge groups of thugs flooded the streets chanting for Mubarak to stay, and the army was still neutral. And during the following two days, on the 2nd and 3rd of February, the thugs attacked the demonstrators with camels and horses which resulted in the death of 10 martyrs and the injury of over than 1500 demonstrator. The army stood passively neutral and let the thugs and the snipers attack the revolutionaries. The thugs were also let climb the buildings overlooking El-Tahrir square to throw Molotov cocktails on the demonstrators The army was simply mimicking the role of the police days before, letting the thugs attack the demonstrators so they could be guilt-free... The army, Id say, participated in this attack with its negativity and ignoring the security and the protection of the citizens. 4- The involvement of the Egyptian intelligence in a trial to use some politicians to incite the revolutionaries to leave El-Tahrir square. One of the documents that was leaked from the state security headquarter in Nasr City, after breaking in on the 5th of March, reveals that a major in the armed forces named Khalid Mohamed Mohsen Sharkawy visited the secretary general of the Arab league, Amr Mousa, asking him to speak to the demonstrators to leave El-Tahrir square, which is what actually happened; Amr Mousa went to the square and asked the demonstrators to accept what Mubarak offered in his 2nd speech.. The question is: If the army has really joined the revolution, why does the Intelligence do the effort to break it down? And if the Intelligence sector was working against the revolution, why didnt the army put an end to these deviations? The document leaked from State Security 5- On the 3rd of February, the military police broke into the office of Amnesty International Organization and Hesham Mubarak center for human rights and other international human rights centers, confiscated their files, arrested their leaders, and they delivered the ones who happen to be there to the thugs to be beaten up!!! 6- The military police arrested so many activists, collaborating with the state security and thugs; on January the 30th Malek Adly was arrested, on February the 3rd the blogger Sand Monkey was arrested on his way –with medical aids- to El-Tahrir square, a few hours later his blog was blocked. On the 4th of February, Wael Abbas, the blogger, and I were arrested, and on the 6th of February the blogger Kareem Amer was arrested… Some estimated that the number of demonstrators who got arrested during these two weeks was over than 10,000, detained in tens of military detention places in Cairo and other areas of Egypt, the most important of those were the military prison in the Hike-step area and the Military Intelligence in Nasr City in front of Tiba mall. Those demonstrators told stories after they were released about torturing and killing of many other demonstrators by the officers of the army and the Intelligence, and here are some testimonies: A- My personal testimony: One of the military tanks arrested me on the 4th of February next to Dar El Qadaa El Aaly- The supreme Court on my way to El-Tahrir square, I was then delivered to the military police, and then to one of the army barracks, and then I was delivered to the military intelligence in Nasr City in front of Tiba Mall.. I was beaten up more than once, and sexually harassed, and all the day I was listening to voices of other detained demonstrators screaming out of pain and torture (Full details here). Day two after I was released, my father was punished also by changing his position at work. B- The report of the The Guardian”, which published a report on demonstrators who were detained and tortured in the Egyptian Museum in El-Tahrir square. And a testimony of a demonstrator named Ashraf who was arrested on his way to El-Tahrir carrying medical aids, and then he was tortured and sexually harassed and threatened to be raped and killed. A third testimony for another demonstrator who was arrested, beaten up, electrified, and then he was sent to Abdeen Police station in Downtown Cairo, where he was beaten up for more than half an hour once he entered the police station. C- The testimony of Mohamed Ibrahim El Saeed Ibrahim that was documented by the blogger Amira El Tahawy”... Mohamed is a young man from Alexandria who was on his way to visit his mother in the hospital, but he was arrested by the army and detained at the Third area military camp. Mohamed and his fellows were subject to torture with whips, metal bars, continuously splashing water on them. He was screened on state-run-Television as one of the thugs that the army arrested. Mohamed was moved to more than one prison, and during his period of detention, many demonstrators were murdered. D- The report of Amnesty International Organization that included testimonies of young people who were arrested and tortured by the military police with whips and electric shocks... It also includes a testimony of a young man who was detained and tortured at Nasser Military Academy in Agouza Area, Giza. E- The testimony of Kareem Amer, the blogger. Kareem was arrested by the military police on the 6th of February 2011 by the military police, and he was detained, with the colleague Sameer Eshra, at the military prison at the Hike-step area. Kareem wrote, after being released, about the torture crimes in the prison and how the demonstrators were tortured by the whips and electric shocks, and water splashes every now and then despite the cold weather... And on the 10th of February 2011, the military prison released 3000 demonstrators on a deserted road, without their items after being splashed with cold water... It was 3 am when this happened. A man was tortured by the army. Photo by El-Nadim Center 7- The army tried to invade into El-Tahrir square more than once during the period from the 4th to the 10th of February 2011 to kick the protesters out. This resulted in many clashed between the protesters and the army, one of those was the clash at the night of the 6th of February when the troops next to the Egyptian Museum tried to make some progress into the square but they were met by the protesters, who made human chains to prevent the troops, so the army shot in the air threatening them, and arrested 3 protesters.. Till this moment, we have no information about these 3 protesters. The third phase: After the stepping down speech (Since February 12 until now) After the stepping down speech, the army adopted a media style conveying a message that they joined the revolution, but at the same time they did everything to ensure suppression of the revolution or at least to guarantee that it won’t gain any extra Privileges. 1- The control of incorporeal affairs over media The Incorporeal Affairs Department is one of the Egyptian armys departments. Its normal job is to preserve the general incorporeal status of the nation during war time. Since the coup d’état in 1952, all the armed sections diverted from their main course of their jobs. And it’s known that there were investigations done to officials in the Intelligence agency after the 1967 defeat, Safwat Al-Sherif was among the investigated officers. This was done because of the sexual immoral deviations of the intelligence. The incorporeal affairs diverted from its role as well. It became a Repressive department of which its main role was to deceive the nation and control public opinion. When I visited the incorporeal affairs in April 2010, the leading officials were bragging about how they are controlling the public opinion and directing the groups and individuals trends. A- The first thing the incorporeal affairs did was to ban photography in El-Tahrir square. The aim was to isolate the rebels emotionally away from the other Egyptian people. So, the revolutionists that were harshly attacked started to feel that they got abandoned by their own people. On the other hand, the rest of Egyptians started to wonder for what reasons are those other people revolting as they have no idea of how strongly they were being suppressed and attacked. photography is banned according to army orders B- On Feb. 15th 2011, some officials in the higher council conducted a meeting with chief editors of newspapers and media icons and gave clear orders to stop any discussions of Mubarak’s wealth. The council requested also to help in improving the image of policemen, towards the evening of the same day, Egyptians were shocked to find that all talk shows hosted policemen trying to polish their image and claimed that there was intruders amongst rebels and this obliged them to use live bullets as a self-defense. C- On Feb. 16th 2011, the army created a page on Facebook, using a very emotional speech trying to draw people to their side and promote for its lies. D- The IA (The Incorporeal Affairs) exploited its own men working in national newspapers and independent ones in polishing and brightening the history of higher council officials. one of the most crudest reports, was the one published by the 7th day newspaper (Al-Youm Al-Sabe3) under the title Field Marshal Tantawy: the second military governor in the history of Egypt and hero of the three wars, forgetting that Tantawy was the defense minister during Mubarak’s rule for 20 years, and before this was the chief of national republic guard for 3 years. E- On 26th Feb. 2011, the IA assigned major general, Tarek El-Mahdi (one of IA members) as a general supervisor over the television and radio union, which led to Egypt entering a phase of directed media by a perverse department inside the army. Tarek El-Mahdi started his job very soon after he was assigned (on the 27th Feb. 2011) by excluding Mahmoud Saad and interrogating him, in addition to distorting Saads reputation. This happened after Saad refused to do an interview with Ahmad Shafik (the prime minister who is assigned by Mubarak and refused by the nation). The funniest thing was that Al-Masry Al-Youm newspaper after posting the news about Saads interrogation, deleted the news feed, this opens a question on what was the pressure imposed on the newspaper to ban such a piece of information from people? F- SMSs used to steer the nation. The army forced the mobile companies to send SMSs to people. One of the silliest SMS was one saying “we waited for 30 years; there is no harm in waiting for just a little bit more. While the truth is that people have kept silence with this dictatorship for 59 years, not 30. Egypt has been the prisoner of such Tyranny since the July coup d’état in 1952 and Mubarak was merely the extension of this system. The army used the SMS to threaten people in order not to participate in sit ins. The army even incited people to stand to rebels. SMS like “it is the sit in of some sections although conditions are normal is what is holding us from stepping forward or” it’s the duty of decent patriots to stand in the face of irresponsible individuals. The SMS were used as well to sweet talk people without any tangible improvements, like “we are fully aware of peoples needs and working hard to meet the expectations. 2- Dispersing the Demonstrations by force in Tahrir Square: One day after the president’s declaration of leaving his position, the army started to repeat the same intelligence discourse that was repeated after each of the three presidential speeches. It started telling the demonstrators: You triumphed and the revolution is over, so, go back to your homes, production should be resumed bla, bla, bla … etc. Such discourse signifies that the revolution should stop. Army Officer ordering demonstrators to leave A- On February 12th 2011, the military police forces intervened by force at night, assisted by some thugs and state security agents. They assaulted the demonstrators, stole some computers of the people’s committees and it were said that one of the demonstrators died while he was battered. B- Starting February 12th, the army banned photographing in Tahrir Square, so that no one would know about the massive violence committed by the army. On February 13th, while I was in Tahrir, I saw one of the demonstrators carrying a label that reads “photography is banned according to army orders”. “Since when do revolutionaries take orders from the army?” I asked him. He replied by complaining to me from the violence committed by the army against the demonstrators a day earlier, and that this lead to the withdrawal of some demonstrators from the square, so that the army became able to intervene violently with the remaining smaller number of the demonstrators. C- On February 13th 2011, the military police battered some people who were protesting in Tahrir Square. Al-Jazeera Channel broadcast a live video of the military police using thick sticks in an attempt to disperse the protestors who were sitting-in. D- On February 14th 2011, the violence committed by the army reached a high peak. The army succeeded in dispersing all sorts of demonstrations in the square. Tens of injured persons were carried to Qasr Al-Ainy hospital. The military police injured them during forcibly dispersing the demonstrations. Then, the army published a statement in which it warned the citizens against demonstrating. E- On February 16th 2011, the blogger Wael Abd el Fattah quoted Bothaina Kamel, a media lady, about the violent assault of the military police against a group of youth near Ramsis Central Communication Office. F- On February 21st 2011, some people of Suez gathered in front a military zone to ask about their kids who were arrested by the army, and were not released even after Mubarak left his position. The army dispersed them violently. Meanwhile, a tank hit the Egyptian woman I’tidal Ahmed Ghouneim and killed her on spot. On the following day, one of the army leaderships apologized to the demonstrators in front of the same military zone and promised to organize a court trial for the tank driver. However, did any of you ever heard about the trial of this soldier? Or did any of those arrestees were ever released up till this day? No one knows. G- The army repeated its violence on February 25th 2011, as the army leaderships in Tahrir Square refused to allow the establishment of any tents or stages, one of them even threatened to kill the demonstrators (see the video here) After 7 p.m., the army cut the electric supply to the square in preparation to what was planned to happen by midnight. After midnight, military police forces aided by Sa’iqa and private forces attacked the demonstrators violently. They battered them with thick iron, wooden sticks and electrified whips. The demonstrators were forcibly dispersed and many of them were arrested. o As regards this last incidence, it is worth mentioning to refer to the testimony of the blogger Mohammed Moussa. Mohammed is an activist who participated in the sit-in in front of the cabinet building on February 25th 2011. He was arrested and tortured with some other revolutionaries by the military police in the early hours of February 26th. Though there are more relevant details about torture, yet, the most interesting is that the military police soldiers accused the revolutionaries of being paid by some foreigners to attack Mubarak. Moreover, the military police officers forced the revolutionaries to yell in support of Mubarak. It is worth mentioning that such details took place on February 25th, two weeks after Mubarak left his presidential position!! H- On February 26th 2011 morning, the Supreme Military Council posted a statement on its Facebook page stating that the clashes that happened on the day before were not intentional, and that no orders were given to carry them out? Were the Sa’iqa and private forces present in the square by mere chance? And why did not the army interrogate the officers who violated the military orders? It was a very deceptive statement. It did not pay any apology, and it stated that the clashes were not intended (i.e., they were friendly firing). It was deceptive also when it gave the day February 25th the name “The Friday of Loyalty”, in spite of the fact that it was a Friday of purifying the system, not of declaring the people’s loyalty to Mubarak. The army deleted this statement after the youth expressed their rage about it on the Facebook, and they posted an alternative statement carrying the same number (22) but without mentioning the term Friday of Loyalty. Nevertheless, on Saturday noon, when the army statement was being posted on the Facebook, and when the secret intelligence authority agents were copying it and saying that the army apologized, the army was forcibly dispersing a demonstration in Tahrir Square by hitting the demonstrators with thick and electrified sticks!!!! Friday of Loaylty???? The amended version of the statement In this statement the army is lying, because if the Supreme Military Council gave orders to release the revolutionaries, why did Amr Al-Behairie was sentenced to imprisonment two days only after the release of this statement? o It is worth mentioning that the army used the same logic in its treatment of most of the demonstrations all over the country. On February 16th 2011, the armed forces besieged the employees of the manpower offices who were sitting-in in front of the ministry of manpower in Nasr City and attempted to forcibly disperse them… In the same day, the armed forces prevented the journalists from entering Mahala Textile Company [to cover the sit in of its laborers], as well as preventing the second shift laborers from joining their fellows inside the company and ordering them to return to their homes… And on February 14th 2011 the armed forces published a statement saying that they will never tolerate any demonstrations of sit-ins... On March 3rd 2011, the military police arrested 20 EBESCO laborers and battered one of them. 3- The Army continues to detain and torture activists who participated in the revolution. Although the armed forces repeatedly pretended to have taken the side of the revolution, they continued to detain and torture activists just like before the revolution, as if nothing had changed A- On February 17, Al Jazeera news channel broadcast a report about a young man who had been detained during the days of the revolution and his torture continued for 4 days after Mubarak had stepped down. B- Ahmad El-Sobkis testimony, documented by Eng. Wael Nawara (Secretary general of Al-Ghad party)… Ahmad El-Sobki along with 25 other protesters were arrested in Tahrir Square by the military police on February 23rd and tortured by the military through brutal beating and electric shocking in genitals and molesting the women. C- The incidence of torturing Mohammed Saad Ayyad which was exposed by the lawyer Ameer Salem. Mohammed Saad was tortured for several days after Mubarak had stepped down; he was beaten by electric batons and tortured through his genitals. Do you know what happened to Amir Salem for having exposed this incidence? An attempt of assassination. Yes, an attempt to assassinate Amir Salem… So has the regime really changed? D- Nadim Centers report published by Al Badeel website on February 23rd, 2011… Al Nadim uncovered the detention of around 1000 protesters arrested by the police during the first days of the revolution and who are still detained in Al Wadi Al Gadeed prison (without any legal procedures)… One day prior to that, the Minister of Interior Mahmoud Wagdy (who is supported by the armed forced) declares on TV that there were no detainees who had participated in the revolution… Note that the number of missing people from January 28 were around 1000 protesters which means that those missing protesters were forcefully detained by the Ministry of Interior with the knowledge and approval of the armed forces… Also worthy of mention that on February 13th, the armed forces sent a group of officers to Tahrir Square to convince the protesters to evacuate the square. I told one of the officers that we want the release of all detainees; he then told me that the detainees will not be released until we evacuate the square. (This means that the detainees were kept as hostages to get us to evacuate the square). The strange thing is the square was evacuated a few days after that and the detainees have not yet been released to this day, and we fear that the Ministry of Interior might kill all the detainees to erase all traces of its crimes. E- Mrs. Ayda Seif El Dawlas testimony (Al Nadim center) on some of the previous detainees who were detained again after Mubarak had stepped down. Notice that the lying Minister of Interior said that he will not sign any detention orders. Does that mean that we have entered a time in which civilian detention is done without even a managerial decision? Mrs. Ayda listed the names of the people detained by the past regime, were released then detained again after Mubarak stepped down!!! F- Shorouk newspapers testimony, March 1, 2011… Shorouk newspaper had received information that assured the detention of some of the protesters of January 25 in Al Wadi Al Gadeed prison after 3 weeks from Mubaraks departure. Again, these protesters were not convicted in court and there were no official orders to detain them. What right does the Ministry of Interior have to detain them until now? G- Arresting Amr Abdullah El Behairy… Amr was one of the activists who took part in the protests on Friday evening February 25, 2011. After midnight, Amr, like all other protesters, was beaten and the military police finally arrested him… On Sunday, news websites published Amrs picture among a group of protesters and the armed forces claimed he was one of the thugs who were interpolated between the protesters and they falsely accused them of bearing weapons. They were taken to court on Monday and on Tuesday were sentenced to 5 years in jail… The protesters were tried in t",29696,9,0,30,NULL,http://www.maikelnabil.com/2011/03/army-and-people-wasnt-ever-one-hand.html,47,null,US,-0.421328,English,51,"2020-07-21 12:30:00"

They were covering my eyes and there was a group of intelligence officers making conversations with many Egyptian activists who were arrested as me (9 of them were arrested while going out from El-Barada’i home). One of the intelligence officers told me in front of them “if we collected those 20 activists it would be 10% of what you did”, so I replied, “I am a humble person and I see that all of them are better than me”. Before that, when I was writing about me being arrested or any abuse being practiced against my rights, I considered this a type of an nonviolent war between me and the regime, meaning that that abuse my rights and I reply back by exposing them in front of the world, and the exposing usually makes good effect. But, this time I’m writing in a different way because this is the first time I feel that I’m a victim, and the first time I would be insulted that much. I’m writing this time not to take revenge, but to let people know what would happen to them if this revolution failed. Our revolution will protect us from these actions to be repeated against me and all of you. Friday, 4th February – In front of the High Court - I was heading to El-Tahrir in the noon of Friday Feb. 4th, to attend the protest. I went out from Gamal Abdlenaser Metro Station. Army officer standing beside a tank stopped me in the way to El-Tharir sq. and searched me 3 times, took my banners, my mobile and my ID then asked me to wait! - “Civil state, not religious or military” , ” No for Omar Soliman or Ahmed Shafik “, ” 59 years are enough, Army” and ” My name is Maikel and will demonstrate despite the pop shenoda said” Was some slogans on my banners. Army officers were stopping any one with bags and i saw them not allowing people with Medical aids! - I asked to speak to someone higher and he pointed his finger to some one civilian, told me he’s an intelligence officer, I went to him wondering, why are you not allowing me to enter while Omar Soliman and Ahmed Shafik Pledged to allow protesting?, he said “we have direct orders to don’t allow protesters to enter!” then he tied me from my back and connect me to the tank. People started to ask why I’m tied to the tank, I started to speak to them, so the intelligence officer took me to beside Revoli cinema theater to be away of people. I didn’t give up and started to chant against Hosni Mubarak and tell protesters to tell media that i got arrested. The intelligence officer came and slapped me on the face! And what really depressed me that people in the popular committees were helping the army to arrest me, thinking that the army is standing by us! The Way to Unit 9770 c7 - A military police car with 440700 numbers came and took me, with a military police captain his name is” Mokhtar”. This captain was helping police by Ammo in the Friday of angry Jan. 28th, and then protests set his car in fire. He was insulting protesters along the way to our distention, and he beaten me on the head several times. I was surprised that he was passing on the popular committees with greeting some other civilian intelligence officers with some other Mubarak thugs and they were planning to arrest people heading to El-Tahrir sq. - He drove his car through El-Sharabya, then stopped in a military area carrying the name” Unit 9770 c7 “. There were lots of arrested demonstrators there. There were also lots of foreigners, whom they ordered to leave the unit without their passports (because they burned their passports) - At about 3:30 Pm, they tied my hands again behind me, and tied a cloth over my eyes. Then they put me in a microbus with other arrested demonstrators. Then we moved toward our unknown destination. The car of Officer Mokhtar, which the revolts burned In the Intelligence Headquarters - After around 30 minutes driving, the car stopped in an open silent place and it stopped there around 4 hours, we didn’t know where we are? And nobody told us anything. There was a near mosque, was praying “Elasr”, and “Elesha”. Army officers were really giving attention to me, because I was the only politician with political slogans in this group! Captain Mokhtar was Motivate others against me, we were hearing voices of people getting tortured. Officers around me were speaking about someone had been shoot in his leg because he tried to escape and he was bleeding without any help! - They bring me alone away of others, and ”El-Zaffa” started. ” El-Zaffa” is an expression will-known by the old arrested people in Egypt and “El-Zaffa” is about high dose of beating and scaring that are given to new political prisoners! Someone was catching my nick and forced me to be bending over! And lots of beating sounds around me and some old intelligence officer was saying Rejoiced words! - An army officer came to me and said this is The Headquarter of State Security Department, to remove suspicions about intelligence or army” and threatened me to be tortured if i didn’t complied with orders. He said “be quiet”, every few minutes some army officer was coming to me and asking about my name, my address, where i got arrested, and if answered the other officer beats me saying ” i said be quiet ” and if i didn’t answer he beats me and says ” answer”! And they kept doing the same stuff for around 30 minutes! - Then, they started to move me and put me in different places, and every few minutes some army officers come and speak to me for a while. I’ve spoken to around different 10 army officers in that night! I think they were recording by video cam! This happened till 2.30 am, which means more than 6 hours of Investigations! They speak with me about my pacifism, my refusal to the military service, and why this revolution must be ended because the president did all what we asked about! - Investigations with each activist and been heard by some other activist deliberately, i have heard some Investigations with others and i believe the same thing happened with me! They were targeting to be heard while saying what they want after all torture we got! And when activists listen to each other will lose their respect to their selves! That’s why when they met me with some youth from El-Barada’i campaign i said these youth are heroes and better than me, i did that because i want to confirm that we all respect each-others! - It was very clear that all officers have personal loyalty to Mubarak, i was very sad about the Egyptian army because it has loyalty to a dictator! I envy Tunisia about its army! - There was a very Sassy army officer, i think he was the same person that received me by beating in” El-Zaffa”. He told me that he’s 50 years old; he seemed to be a leader in the intelligence! He said, ” Would you serve in the army, Maikel? ” i said ” No.” then he started discussing me about my pacifist beliefs , they didn’t respect the freedom of belief, he said “You’ll serve in the army.” i said that won’t happen.” he said “you’ll get Court-martial” i said ” i choose by myself to get Court-martial when i refused to serve in the army, so it’s OK to get it now.”, also he was very nervous from the foreign persons I contact through my Email, it seems they’re no happy with my work with the pacifist European organizations ! - They were playing the old ” good officer” and ” evil officer” game, a one dealing with us in a bad way and the other one dealing in a very kind way! - They were ridiculing on Christianity all the time, they gave care to know if I’m Orthodox, Catholic, or Protestant, and they listen me to the lord’s prayer! - They used to assert always that there’s no law here to protect us, and they can make with us however they want, honestly it was true! We were treated as captured enemy soldiers at war. All the time, we were tied from our backs, blinded, blending over, don’t know where we are, and we were not allowed to speak with each others! It’s really not the way to deal with good citizens in their homeland! - At 2.30 am they let me sleep alone on open air on ground, i wasn’t with others, ” like Solitary” they didn’t give me a blanket like others, but gave me a carpet, and it was very rough, all my hands had been hurt because of it! - I spent around 29 hours, till i been freed in the second day, but i was unblinded only in the toilet, and this was the time that i know what time was! Sexual harassment! - The first, sexual harassment i got, was from a small officer that arrested me in downtown, he searched my Genital, but i passed this situation as a part of searching! - Second, in ” El-Zaffa” when they was catching my nick, and making me blend over and someone from the back trying to lowered my jeans to give me impression that I’ll be raped! - Third, Conscripts, were taking me from officer to other, one of them entered his hands inside my jeans and held me from my boxer! - They were dealing with me like a female, some officer was speaking to his colleague like” I’ll come to you after i finish with her” - I faced higher officers with that stuff and they acted like they don’t know, but in the second day these things stopped! Freedom again, Saturday Feb. 5th 2011 - In the second day we spent till 2.30 pm in open air place and it was raining but they didn’t give a damn to move us to a different place! at 2.30 they moved me to the prison area, they were releasing many people, it was around 8 prisons each floor, the building was two floors, ” around 16 prison”, which means that they had over 300 prisoners. One prison had arrested female demonstrators, and they weren’t allowing the girls to go to the toilets! - They were releasing everybody and put me in a corner without knowing what will happen to me! They were also bringing new arrested people that confirming the fake of Ahmed Shafik and Omar Soliman statements! At 6.30 Pm they put handcuffs in my hands, i scared because it was the first time in two days (they were tying me with a rope before). They well blinded my eyes, and they woke me long time in sand, i felt they will shoot me” they were criminals’, but they stopped a cab, put me inside, and asked me not to open my eyes except after minutes. I was only caring to go out this place alive! Two days with lots of scare and pain, i don’t want anyone to get similar experience in his/her life! After the cab drove for a while i unblinded my eyes, to see myself in El-Tayaran ST. in Nasr city, so i knew that i was in some military place in Raba’a El-Adawya in Nasr city!

90,"Statement: I Would Not Serve in the Egyptian Army and I Bear the Consequences","2010-10-21 00:00:00","Maikel Nabil",null,"Statement: I Would Not Serve in the Egyptian Army and I Bear the Consequences >> 21 October 2010 #fullpost{display:inline;} I can accept that I would be forced to lose my freedom, but I’m not ready to give it up with my own free will. Last Monday, 18th of October, I was informed with the final decision by the Egyptian Military Institution to nominate me as a reserve officer for the armed forces. It is supposed that I deliver myself to the recruitment area to where I am included, On next Friday (22nd of October, 2010), to be transferred to the College of Reserve Officers at Fayed ( Ismailia ), to start a compulsory military service for 3 years. During the last period, I was thinking too much of the correct decision which I have to take in that situation. I am a liberal activist since 2005; I have called for the ideas of individualism and individual liberties. I talked and wrote too much against the military regime of the 23th of July, 1952. I criticized the ideas of nationalism and the fascism that took over the Egyptian policies ever since the militarists came to power. I talked and extremely defended the right of both of the societies of Egypt and Israel to co-exist peacefully, to end the state of the continued conflict between them. I refused the continued harassment which the Egyptian regime does against Israel, as getting involved in without a justification in the 1948 war. As well as, the assault of the Egyptian regime on the right of Israel in the navigation in the international straits and the Egyptian regime’s support for terrorists who do violent activities against the Israeli citizens. In April, 2009 I have founded the movement, No for Compulsory Military Service” (Arabic: لا للتجنيد الإجبارى) as the first Egyptian movement to promote for pacifism, the right of the Egyptians in the Conscientious Objection, and the superiority of the voluntary recruitment compared to the compulsory recruitment. I thought too much and my decision was that I would refuse to do the military service in Egypt and I would bear the consequences whatever they would be. Despite of my knowledge that the consequences would be a misfortune as I am considered the first Egyptian youth to reject the compulsory military service because of my pacifist beliefs. My decision has many reasons: - Of which I am pacifist, against holding weapons, against joining the military formations and paramilitary. Accepting the recruitment would be coercion against my conscientious beliefs and my humanistic principles. I am not ready to go against my conscience and beliefs no matter what is the price. - Also, I am not ready for being a piece of chess in the race to armament and the conflicts with the floods of blood which immerses the region. I am not ready for being holding a weapon against an Israeli youth, compulsory recruited, who defends the existence of his country. I am not ready for being just a number that generals would play with in the business of warfare in the Middle East. - Additionally, I consider the compulsory recruitment as a type of slavery and I am a free person. I struggled for long years for my freedom. I struggled against my family, my religious group, the society and the police. I paid the price of my freedom very well and I won it. Right now I am not ready for giving up my freedom with my own hands to military gangs. All they can do is to kill, slaughter and bloodshed. I am more virtuous than taking instruction of military people. - Above all, I am aware to the size of the intelligence publicity in which the military institution did against me for all the past period of time and their consecutive accusations against me with being an agent, treason and working for the interests of foreign bodies. After that sizable fierce publicity, I have become afraid on my life and my bodily safety in the armed forces, especially under circumstances of a law establishment which prevents existence of inspection for the violations which happen inside the military institution. Under the circumstances of the existence of the military court which isn’t neutral and which is part of the military institution that accuses me with the previous accusations. My carefulness on my life and my bodily safety make me accept years in prison, more than risking being subjected to being assassinated inside the army. But, my words don’t mean that I am an evader of the military recruitment. I am rejecting, not evading. I live in the same address written on my identification card which is known to the Administration of Recruitment and Mobilization, the Military Security Forces and the Intelligence, which also is written in my letters to Minister of Defense, the Prime Minister, Heads of both Houses of Parliament and the President of the Republic. I am not hiding anywhere so the Egyptian police can arrest me anywhere and I am fully prepared to deliver myself to justice once I am being informed that I am wanted. I only want to ensure that I am still a civil person (According to the Egyptian Legal System). The person becomes a soldier after getting a conscript card, handing it to his unit and wearing the military uniform. Nothing of the previous happened to me. I am here assuring that I’m a civil person. It hasn’t happened to me that I joined the Armed Forces, so I have the right to be tried in front of a civil court. Any attempt to try me in front of a military court represents a violation against my rights as a civil person. Also, assuring my legal position that I am legally absent from the military service (not an evader) and the absent has no legal punishment except that when he goes to be recruited afterward, he would be recruited for one additional year. Subsequently, the military institution has no right to arrest me or make a lawsuit against me on not going to be recruited in the specified date. I know that my decision means that I will pay a very high price. It means that I will lose my political rights for my whole life. It means that I won’t be able to travel outside of Egypt for a long time. It means that I will find difficulty to work, because I don’t have the military certificate. It means that I will constantly become subjected to harassment by Police Forces. Above all, I may be subjected to imprisonment more than once and for long periods of times. But freedom has a price and I am a free person. I have no objection on paying the price of my freedom. With sacrifices such as this, great democracies were established in Europe and America. - Sacrifices of the American activists in the 1970s and the consecutive sentences of imprisonment that were held against them, were the price that was paid for the United States retrieval of the Vietnam war and to end the military service in America. - Sacrifices of activists in east Europe that some were killed and many others were imprisoned to stop the ethnic slaughterings in Europe, to change Europe from a place of ethnically grinding to a strong European union practicing a very respectable role in the international politics. Also, having very high standards for human rights not even found in America. - Sacrifices of the pacifist Israeli soldiers who were subjected to too much imprisonment so that they would not hold a weapon in our faces. Their sacrifices don’t deserve from me less than having to take the same position and to refuse to hold a weapon against their faces. I am part of the movement of the peoples that chose peace and refuse war and blood. With my position, I am glad to record a new position in the history of Egypt between the military institution and the Egyptian citizens. I hope that the day comes when the Egyptian military goes back to its barracks and to stop interfering in politics, so Egypt would be transformed into a civilian country without powers of military people on civilians and so that the military trials would be abolished, the traveling permissions, censorship by the intelligence on newspapers and its role in the political conflict protecting the military regime. I wish that the day would come that Egypt would be transformed into a secular liberal state, respecting the individualist values, peace, the freedom of choice for individuals and to adopt the concepts of professionalism and modernity in its philosophy for forming its national army.

None of them replied to my letters, so I decided to go on talking with International Officials who could help me in my case This is the Letter I send yesterday, To the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs. Navanethem Pillay On her Email: InfoDesk@ohchr.org Letter to the High Commissioner for Human Rights Dear Mrs. Navanethem Pillay, The High Commissioner for Human Rights My Name is Maikel Nabil Sanad; Im an Egyptian citizen, 25 years old... Im a Blogger and a Human Rights activist from about 5 years. Im a pacifist, against wars; Ive never carried a weapon. I support peace in the region, especially between Egypt & Israel. Im also the Head of Egyptian Antimilitarist Movement named “No for Compulsory Military Service . We have activated from the beginning of 2009, Against Egyptian Obligatory Military Service Laws, I gave several lectures on this topic allover Egypt, and we have done lots of campaigns trying to force the government to change obligatory military service law. The law here in Egypt obligates males to serve in the army for 1 to 3 years (and may be more); there is no legal method to postpone it. Also the law here doesn’t give citizens their right in Conscientious Objection.... But the law gives the Minister of Defense the Authority to exclude whoever he wants from the obligatory Military Service In our Campaigns we depend a lot on the documents released by United Nations Commission On Human Rights, especially The Resolution of the Commission on Human Rights, 10 March 1993 and The Report of the High Commissioner to the Commission on Human Rights, 14 March 2002 ... All those documents, which ensures the right of every human-being in a Conscientious Objection from the military Service. I finished my college last year, and according to the law, I was submitted to the army forces to be recruited. The military authorities decided that I should serve in the army for 3 years (which could be extended more than this period) So, I sent Letters to Ministry of Defense, Prime Minister, Heads of the parliament, And the President of Egypt ... I asked them for my right in a Conscientious Objection and an exception from the obligatory military Service, because of My Pacifist beliefs, Based on the constitutional articles supports Individual and Religious freedoms... And none of them replied me till now (the first letter to the ministry of defense was in 29 July 2010) Now, According to the army instructions, I have to begin my military service in 20 October 2010 (after a week)... And If I didnt go to my service at that time, they will take me to a military trial, and jail me to a period which may reach to 15 years in a military prison. Im asking you, with your authorities and responsibilities, to contact the Egyptian Regime, Demanding My safety, and my right in Conscientious Objection from the military Service ... My right to not being forced to carry weapons participating in the increasing conflicts in Middle East. Respect, Maikel Nabil Sanad I hope anyone who reads this, supports me to have my right in Conscientious Objection, and make sure that I remain safe and free without any trial here in Egypt More Details about Our Movement http://www.maikelnabil.com/2010/06/overview-on-no-for-compulsory-military.html Notice: The letters I sent to the Egyptian Officials are available in Arabic, but I have Google Translation, which will be of a good value حملة خطابات لمسئولين مصريين أعتراضا على الخدمة العسكرية خطاب لوزير الدفاع فى رفض الخدمة العسكرية خطاب ثانى لوزير الدفاع ، طلب بالإستثناء من الخدمة العسكرية خطاب لرئيس الوزراء فى رفض الخدمة العسكرية خطابات لرئيسى مجلسى الشعب و الشورى ، فى رفض الخدمة العسكرية خطاب لرئيس الجمهورية فى رفض الخدمة العسكرية Posted by Maikel Nabil Sanad at 3:32 p.m. Labels: Articles - En 2",4099,10,0,2,NULL,http://www.maikelnabil.com/2010/10/letter-to-high-commissioner-for-human.html,47,null,US,0.102813,English,1,"2020-07-21 12:30:00"
92,"Overview on: No for Compulsory Military Service Movement","2010-06-16 00:00:00","Maikel Nabil",null,"Overview on: No for Compulsory Military Service Movement >> 16 June 2010 We are an Egyptian movement, established on Facebook in 9th of April 2009; Against the Egyptian laws of military service... We aim to abolish Compulsory draft and replace it by optional conscription. We also are aiming to reform the relation between citizens and military institution, ending any authorities of militarists on civilians, deepening the civil state, and evolving qualification, organization and standard liberties and rights in Egyptian army. Our movement is politically neutral... its founders and members belong to several and bulk of political movements... and there&#8217;s no any political intention for this movement except exterminating compulsory military service. All the members of our movement are Egyptians, and we have lots of friends from many other countries, all of them act to abolish military service in their countries. In 1952, Egypt faced a coup d&#8217;état by some contingent of army. Soldiers blockaded the royal palace and forced the king to leave Egypt. Then they canceled the Egyptian constitution of 1923, declared Egyptian republic, commandeered newspapers, and repealed political parties. Since that day and till now, Egypt is under military rule, Soldiers governing it one by one ... Till now, militarists still control everything in civilian life, and damn on miserable way anyone who dares and think of objecting the military government. Egypt has a compulsory military service law, forces every Egyptian male (only males) to serve in the Egyptian army for a period from 1 to 3 years without any fees. And this period could extend more than that, if the conscript had a military trial in the army. Why do we refuse Compulsory Military Service? 1- Because its just a shape of slavery. It takes away freedom of the citizens and forces them to do what they never wanted or choose. 2- Because its a forced labor system. It forces conscripts to work against their will and without charge. 3- Because its a violation of Individual freedom. We believe that every citizen is free to choose and decide everything belongs to him, and this of course includes his choice to join armed forces or not. 4- Because it encroach civil state. It gives militarists authority on civilians and this contrary to principles of civil state. 5- Because the concept of the armies around the world has evolved over time. And the best armies now are professional ones, not the forcibly conscripted armies. 1- Abolishing compulsory military service and replacing it with optional recruitment. 2- Ending all military authorities on civilians like (Military trials, Traveling permission, and military appointment in civilian sites). 3- Allowing the press to monitor military performance, exposing any corruption in the army (Repeal of the law of: prohibition of the dissemination of any information on the armed forces). 4- Guarantee conscripts right in Egyptian army, by all means and ways, to ensure their safety, dignity and freedom. 5- Abolition of all types of racial discrimination within the military establishment (either on the basis of sex, religion, race, family status or any other reason). Our Mechanisms: 1- Electronic Campaigns, especially on social networks, to convey the idea to the maximum percentage of Egyptian youth. 2- Printed brochures, posters, and stickers, to disseminate and clarify the objectives of the movement. 3- Holding seminars, lectures and workshops, in political parties, human rights organizations, in the different provinces to spread our ideas and train activists. 4- Litigation in the Egyptian and international courts, to erase legitimacy of the current military service laws, and urge the parliament to draft a new law that respects individual freedoms. 5- Political alliances, and political argument with stakeholder and all political movements. 6- Provide international cover for the movement, to ensure communication between the opponents to compulsory recruitment in Egypt with their counterparts in other countries, to achieve mutual support, and to protect the Egyptian activists from the terrorism of the Egyptian government. 7- Peaceful demonstrations, strikes and sit-ins. In public places, In front of parliament, International institutions and institutions of the army. 8- Legislative and parliamentary pressure, by persuading lawmakers with the ideas of our movement, and to persuade them to submit an alternative law to the parliament for discussion. Legal aspect: We see that compulsory military service law in Egypt is unconstitutional and loose legitimacy, for the following reasons: 1- Sex discrimination, because military service is compulsory for males, while females are exempted from it. 2- Religion discrimination, since the law reduces the duration of service for the Holy Quran keepers. 3- Military service restricts the right of citizens to travel, which undermine freedom of movement and the right of emigration, which had been endorsed by the constitution and international conventions. 4- Military service law prohibits recruits and who didnt perform military service from possession of political rights, and this is contrary to the principles of equality among citizens. 5- Constitution confirms that the army is the only institution which has the right to undertake the organization of military and paramilitary formations, while the police operates a paramilitary organization (central security), and forces recruits to join it. 6- International covenants imposes on States to develop a legal system for the Conscientious Objection, while the Egyptian Regime doesnt respect these laws. Future of the movement: When we achieve the objectives of the movement, it will automatically converted to a specialized organization in defending the rights of recruits and workers in Egyptian army.

Millions of Egyptians have accounts on Facebook ... And from the Facebook raised the invitation for 6th April strike which was the first Egyptian civil disobeyance.... Nearly, every party and every organization in Egypt has a group in Facebook. Facebook became the most effective communication site which communicate Egyptians together to talk about all the forbidden subjects in Egypt Today , I was logging into my account when Facebook refused to log me on ... they said that my account has been disabled by one of their administrators ...

The inactivation of his account was a method to prevent him to communicate with his friends, and so the terrorists could easily do with him all what they want Not only Mahmoud ...

I was surprised when he told me that the Egyptian law considers the civil disobedience a crime and punish who ever participate in it with 5-10 years in jail , in addition to fine ( Im not sure if this information is true ) .... So I had an idea, I thought that I could publish this law on my blog and that will be a great scoop , as no one from all who wrote about the strike published this law.... so , I asked my friend to bring me a copy of this law from the library of his collage In the following day, my friend went to his collage, entered the library and searched for along time for any book talking about civil disobedience.... but the surprise that all the books discussing civil disobedience disappeared ... so he went to the responsible of the library and asked him about the absent books.... What do you think the answer was? .... He told him that a police officer came early in the morning and collected all the books discussing civil disobedience and took them with him When I heard this I laughed from all of my heart .... Are they afraid to this extent?? ... I couldnt Imagine what would make a respected police officer leave his clean air-conditioned office and go to the university to collect some old papers which no one have read them from years ago?? Few days ago, I left a comment in a popular site and said that our struggle with the regime is uneven, because the regime use guns and pistols, but we dont have any thing except pens, words and the keyboard.... But in this situation, we saw who had the bullets and guns afraid from whom having the pencil, and collecting paper and words to prevent anyone from reading them.... In this time only, I discovered that our struggle is truely uneven, but seems that the pen is more powerful to a great extent than the war machines and the mercenaries Also, Im not participating in this strikes (because of its socialist aims), but after this situation there is a message must reach to all bloggers.... never think that we are a storm in a teacup.... never think that we are useless.... never think that we do nothing .... Never think that our words go to the wind.... never think that we dont participate in changing the world to be better....

3- الحملات الأعلامية أهم من قاعة المحكمة أعتقد أنك تعرف مسبقا أن القضاء في دول المنطقة ليس مستقلا، و أن معظم أحكامه مسيسة. في حالات أستثنائية نادرة، يقرر أحد القضاء الشرفاء الأفراج عن شخص برئ أعتقلته السلطات، و لكن هذا هو الأستثناء من القاعدة. الواقع أن المعتقلين السياسيين يتم الأفراج عنهم حينما يكون هناك ضغط كافي على الأنظمة السياسية من أجل الأفراج عن المعتقلين. لذلك لا تستنفذ وقتك و مجهودك في التعامل مع البيروقراطية داخل المحاكم و المجادلات القانونية. جميع الحملات التي شاركت فيها أنتهت بقرار سياسي، و الأفراج عني شخصيا كان يتم بقرار سياسي و ليس بقرار قضائي. المحاميين قد يستهلكون وقتك الثمين الذي يمكن أستخدامه في بدائل أكثر جدوى. في المحاكمتين العسكريتين التي خضتهما لم يكن هناك دليلا ماديا ضدي، و مع ذلك تم الحكم ضدي لأسباب سياسية. و بعدها تم العفو عني بقرار رئاسي لأسباب سياسية أيضا. أدراكي أن الحملات الأعلامية هي من يمكن أن تحررني، كان السبب في أني قاطعت محاكمتي أمام القضاء العسكري في أغسطس 2011. مهما كنت قدمت أدلة تثبت براءتي للمحكمة، كانت المحكمة ستدينني لأسباب سياسية. ببساطة، أستهلك مجهودك في خلق ضغط سياسي، و أترك المحاكم و الألعاب القانونية للمحاميين فهم أدرى بها. 4- السكوت لا ينفع أبدا بعد كل حادثة أعتقال سياسي، ستجد أحد الأفراد يدعي أنه صديق و حريص على مصلحة صديقك المعتقل، و ينصحك بالبعد عن الشوشرة. قد يكون أحد الأقارب أو الأصدقاء أو المحاميين أو حتى أحد أفراد النظام الحاكم. سيقول لك أن صديقك المعتقل ليس من مصلحته وجود ضوضاء في الأعلام. سيقول لك أن صديقك سيخرج قريبا أذا صمتت انت، و ان الحملات الأعلامية ستدفع السلطات لمزيد من العناد. قد يعرض عليك تدخله الشخصي من أجل حرية صديقك في مقابل أن تصمت تماما. ببساطة، هذا الشخص يطلب منك أن تتخلى عن سلاحك الوحيد الصراخ! للأسف، الأنظمة القمعية لا تفهم إلا لغة القوة. اذا كنت ضعيفا، ستزيد الأنظمة قمعا. أستسلامك و توافقك سيجعل الأنظمة تطمع أكثر فيك. يقول المثل: أذا أعطيت للشيطان أصبعك، فسيأخذ يدك كلها. أنا شخصيا لا أفضل أسخدام القوة العنيفة، لأنها ببساطة ستعطي للأنظمة مبررا لأستخدام المزيد من العنف. اللاعنف يمثل قوة لا يستهان بها في العمل السياسي، و يسميه البعض القوة الناعمة. الحملات الأعلامية هي مصدر قوتك، و قوتك هي اللغة الوحيدة التي يفهمها النظام القمعي. حينما تصمت، فأنت ببساطة تترك سلاحك الوحيد. و كلما يعتقد النظام القمعي أنك ضعيف، سيزيد قمعه لك. لقد شاركت في عشرات الحملات من أجل الأفراج عن المعتقلين السياسيين، و لم أمر بحالة واحدة كان فيها السكوت لمصلحة السجين السياسي. بالعكس، السكوت كان دائما يسمح للسلطات بالتنكيل بالمعتقل في صمت و هدوء. لا تذبح صديقك بصمتك! 5- الكم و الكيف كلاهما لا يمكن الأستغناء عنهما في الحملات الأعلامية، يهدف معظم الأشخاص في الحصول على تضامن أكبر مجموعة ممكنة من البشر. يستخدم النشطاء وسائل التواصل الأجتماعي لتوصيل رسائلهم و يطالبون الجمهور بالمشاركة في بعض الأنشطة التي تؤكد على تضامنهم. جمع التوقيعات على بيانات للمطالبة بالأفراج عن أحد المعتقلين هو أهم الأدوات التي يستعرض بها المشاركين حجم التضامن مع قضيتهم. لكن الذي يهمله الكثيرين هو أن نوعية المتضامنين لا تقل أهمية عن عددهم. يجب أن تستثمر جزءا من مجهودك للحصول على تضامن الأفراد و المنظمات ذوي القوة السياسية، كالسياسيين و الحقوقيين و الفنانين و الرموز الدينية و الأعلاميين. بالطبع، أولئك الأشخاص لن يعطونك تضامنهم بسهولة، و قد تستهلك وقتك محاولا أقناعهم بلا جدوى. و لكن في نفس الوقت أنضمام أحدهم لحملتك سيعطيها قوة معنوية غير قليلة. المشاهير ليسوا هم الفئة الوحيدة التي تحتاج لتضامنها. ما تحتاجه أكثر هو التضامن من الأشخاص المختلفين معك سياسيا. أذا كان المتضامنين مع حملتك هم فقط أفراد من تيارك السياسي أو الديني، فأن قضيتك سيتقبلها الناس على أنها قضية تخص جماعة معينة. أنت تحتاج أن تجعل قضيتك قضية أنسانية يتفق عليها الجميع بغض النظر عن أختلافاتهم السياسية و الدينية. كلما كان الشخص أكثر أختلافا معك في الرأي الديني أو السياسي، كلما كان تأثير تأييده لحملتك أكبر. لأنه وقتها ستكون القضية أمام الرأي العام قضية حقوق أنسان و ليست قضية فصيل سياسي أو ديني محدد. 6- لا تقلل من شأن قضيتك أبدا يجب أن تدرك أنك لا تستطيع أن تقنع الناس بقضيتك ما لم تكن أنت نفسك مقتنعا بها. و لا يمكنك أن تجعل الناس يحترمون من تدافع عنه، ما لم تحترمه أنت أولا. لا تقلل من شأن قضيتك أبدا. أذا كانت قضيتك عادلة، فلا تخجل منها، ولا تستخدم أساليب تقلل من قيمتها. على سبيل المثال، يطالب البعض بالأفراج عن فلان لأنه سنه صغير أو لأنها بنت أو لأن مستقبله هيضيع. هذة المبررات تقلل من قيمة القضية. فلان يجب أن يكون حرا لأنه برئ، و ليس لأنه صغير السن أو أنثي أو طالب. أذا لم يكن هذا الشخص بريئا، فالعدالة أن يتم سجنه بغض النظر عن سنه أو جنسه أو وضعة الدراسي. نفس الشئ يقال عن المضربين عن الطعام. المعتقل السياسي المضرب عن الطعام يجب أن يتم أطلاق سراحه لأنه برئ، و ليس حفاظا على حياته. أذا أضرب قاتل أو أرهابي أو مغتصب عن الطعام مطالبا بالحرية، فليس من المعقول أن يتم أطلاق سراحه حفاظا على حياته. الشخص المضرب عن الطعام لو كان يكترث للحفاظ على حياته ما كان أضرب عن الطعام أصلا. القضية هي كون الشخص برئ أو غير برئ. أستخدامك لأعذار تقلل من قيمة قضيتك سيضعف حجم التعاطف مع قضيتك، و سيقلل من أقتناع الناس مع عدالتها. 7- التحالفات مصدر قوتك الأهم تختلف حملات الأفراج عن المعتقلين السياسيين في قوتها و حجمها حسب عوامل كثيرة. بعض الحملات تنجح في تحقيق هدفها و الأفراج عن المعتقلين في خلال ساعات. بعض الحملات الأخرى قد تضطر للأستمرار لسنوات حتى يستجيب النظام القمعي للضغوط. أذا لم تكن محظوظا، فأنت أمام طريق شاق و مجهود كبير للوصول إلى هدفك. و لذلك فأنت تحتاج لبناء تحالفات مع مجموعات أخرى منظمة. العمل بمفردك سيكون أكثر أرهاقا و أقل ثمارا من العمل من خلال تحالفات. أذا كنت تنتمي لأقلية دينية، لماذا لا تتواصل مع الأقليات الدينية الأخرى و تتحالف معهم؟ يمكنك أن تتضامن معهم في قضاياهم، في مقابل أن يتضامنون معك في قضيتك. أذا كنت تنتمي لحزب سياسي، أعرض التحالف على الأحزاب السياسية الأخرى. بالتأكيد هناك العديد من المعتقلين السياسيين في بلدك أو في الدول المجاورة. تحالف مع حملات الأفراج عنهم. ساعدهم في أنشطتهم للأفراج عن معتقليهم، في مقابل أن يساعدوك هم في أنشطتك للأفراج عمن تدافع عن حريته. في بناء التحالفات يجب أن تدرك شيئين مهمين. أولا: أنك يجب أن تقدم شيئا. أذا لم تقدم للآخرين تضامنا أو دعما، فلن يكون لديهم دافع للتحالف مع حملتك. ثانيا: لا تدع أحد يستغلك. نعم التحالفات تقتضي أن تقدم مساعده ة دعمك لحلفائك و قضاياهم، و لكن دون أن يقلل هذا من تركيزك في قضيتك الأساسية و هي حرية المعتقل السياسي الذي تشارك في حملة الأفراج عنه. عليك أذن أن تخلق توازنا بين ما تقدم لحلفاءك و ما يقدمونه لك. خاتمة نحن محظوظين لأننا لا نعيش في العصور الوسطى، في الأوقات التي كان فيها المخالفون يتم حرقهم أو شنقهم فورا. و لكني لا أعتقد أننا سنكون محظوظين بالقدر الكافي لنرى يوما كوكب الأرض بلا سجناء سياسيين. أنه قدرنا أن نعيش باقي حياتنا ندافع عن سجناء سياسيين في كل مكان، في سوريا أو كوريا أو فينزويلا، أو في أي مكان آخر من باقي بقاع ذلك الكوكب الذي يأبى أن يعيش يوما بلا قهر.

98,"الحركة المعارضة للتجنيد الإجباري في مصر تكتسب زخما جديدا","2015-01-26 00:00:00","Maikel Nabil",null,"الحركة المعارضة للتجنيد الإجباري في مصر تكتسب زخما جديدا >> 26 January 2015 #fullpost{display:inline;} كل سلاح يتم تصنيعه، و كل سفينة حربية يتم أطلاقها، كل صاروخ يتم أطلاقه، هو مال مسروق من الجائعين الذين لا يجدون طعاما الرئيس الأمريكي الأسبق أيزنهاور. معترض ضميري جديد يوم السبت 10 يناير 2015، أعلن مارك نبيل سند – 22 عام – أعتراضه الضميري على الخدمة العسكرية في مصر، و أستعداده لتحمل نتائج قراره. خطوة ليست شائعة في مصر. مارك في بيانه ذكر أنه يعتبر رفضه للخدمة العسكرية مسئولية تجاه اجيال قادمة يجب الا تورث هذه العبودية المسماة التجنيد الاجباري. البيان ذكر خمسة أسباب لرفض الخدمة العسكرية أهمها رفض أستخدام العنف لحل الصراعات، و رفض الأنضمام لمؤسسة لها تاريخ في أنتهاك حقوق الأنسان بمصر، و كذا رفضه لأستخدام الجيش المصري للمدنيين كدروع بشرية من خلال وضع نقاطه العسكرية ضمن المناطق السكنية. كان مارك قد مثل لأجراءات الكشف الطبي بمنطقة تجنيد أسيوط في مايو الماضي طبقا للقانون، وقتها قام بأبلاغ المسئولين بالمنطقة عن رفضه للتجنيد الإجباري و لدور الجيش بعد أنقلاب يوليو 2013. تم توقيف مارك مباشرة و أحتجازة لعدة ساعات بمكتب المخابرات الحربية بمنطقة تجنيد أسيوط، أعقبه تحقيقا آخرا بمقر المخابرات الحربية برابعة العدوية بالقاهرة. أدارة التجنيد و التعبئة قررت بعدها تعليق أجراءات تجنيده، و لكنها منذ ذلك الوقت ترفض تسليمه أي مستند قانوني ينص على موقفة النهائي من الخدمة العسكرية. و بدون هذا المستند يظل مارك حتى اليوم ممنوعا قانونا من الدراسة أو العمل أو السفر للخارج. الرد الأول من نوعه مصطفى أحمد السعيد هو أيضا أحد الشباب الرافضين للخدمة العسكرية الإجبارية. يوم الخميس 27 نوفمبر 2014 تلقى مصطفى ردا رسميا من أدارة التجنيد و التعبئة بوزارة الدفاع بخصوص طلبه أستثناء من الخدمة العسكرية بناء على معتقداته الضميرية المتمثلة في السلمية و اللاعنف. الرد يمثل حدثا فريدا بأعتبارة أول رد مكتوب من الجيش المصري على طلب أعتراض ضميري على الخدمة العسكرية. كان الجيش المصري قد تجاهل كل الخطابات المماثلة من المعترضين الضميريين، سواء التي أرسلتها أنا قبل رفضي للخدمة العسكرية في أكتوبر 2010، أو التى أرسلها عماد الدفراوي و محمد فتحي بعد رفضهم للخدمة العسكرية في 2012. كان مصطفى أحمد السعيد قد تم ترشيحه للخدمة كضابط أحتياط بعد أجتيازه للكشف الطبي بمنطقة تجنيد الزقازيق. بعدها أرسل مصطفى خطابا للفريق أول صدقي صبحي وزير الدفاع و الأنتاج الحربي بتاريخ 12 نوفمبر، يطلب فيه أستثناؤه من الخدمة العسكرية بناء على المادة 54 من الدستور المصري التي تضمن الحرية الشخصية. مصطفى أشار إلى أن نظام التجنيد الإجباري يُعد نوعا من السخرة و العبودية، معلنا رفضه المشاركة في الحروب و انتشار العنف و سفك دماء أي طرف. بعد ساعات من تلقيه رد أدارة التجنيد و التعبئة، تلقى مصطفى أتصالا هاتفيا من مندوب التجنيد بقسم الشرطة التابع له يطلب حضورة لأستدعاء أمني بمنطقة تجنيد الزقازيق. رد أدارة التجنيد و التعبئة أعتبر محاولة رفض التجنيد الإجباري يدل على عدم الأنتماء لهذا الوطن و تهديد لأمنه و سلامته من الأخطار المحيطة. حركة لا للتجنيد الإجباري كانت الحركة المناهضة للتجنيد الإجباري قد بدأت في عام 2006 بكتابات المدون كريم عامر الناقدة لنظام التجنيد القسري، و الداعية لتحول الجيش المصري لنظام تجنيد أختياري. كريم أختفى عن الساحة السياسية بعدها بفتره قصيرة بعد الحكم عليه بالسجن لأربعة سنوات بسبب كتاباته المناهضة للدين و لنظام مبارك. في 2009، قمت مع مجموعة من الليبراليين المصريين تأسيس حركة لا للتجنيد الإجباري كأول تنظيم مصري مناهض للعسكرية و لنظام التجنيد القسري. في 20 أكتوبر 2010، كنت أول مصري يرفض الخدمة العسكرية بعد أن تم ترشيحي للخدمة كضابط أحتياط. الشرطة العسكرية خطفتني من منزلي بالقاهرة بعدها بثلاث أسابيع، و تم أعفائي نهائيا من الخدمة العسكرية بدعوى عدم لياقتي النفسية للخدمة بالقوات المسلحة. في 2012، قام كل من عماد الدفراوي و محمد فتحي برفض الخدمة العسكرية بسبب معتقداتهم السلامية الرافضة للعنف أو حمل السلاح. الجيش كان رد فعله مختلفا وقتها، فقرر أن يتجاهل موقفهما من التجنيد تاركا أياهم في وضع غير قانوني. لأكثر من عامان عاش كلاهما محرومين من الحق في العمل أو التعليم أو السفر. أثناء تلك الفترة أعلنت العديد من المنظمات المناهضة للعسكرية في أوربا و إسرائيل تضامنها مع المعترضين الضميريين. أخلع بعد أنقلاب عبد الفتاح السيسي في يوليو 2013 و أزاحة الرئيس الإسلامي محمد مرسي، بدأت بوادر التمرد على الخدمة العسكرية بين التيارات الإسلامية تظهر تدريجيا. مؤخرا أنشأ بعض شباب التيارات الإسلامية حركة جديدة مناهضة للتجنيد الإجباري بعنوان أخلع. الحركة الجديدة تدعو لرفض نظام التجنيد الإجباري، و تدعو المجندين لترك مواقعهم داخل الجيش. الحركة الجديدة تمثل طفرة في خطاب الحركات الإسلامية في مصر، حيث دأب الإسلاميين في مصر على تمجيد الحياة العسكرية و القتال تحت مسمى الجهاد، و في السنوات السابقة كان الإسلاميين معارضين بشدة لحركة لا للتجنيد الإجباري. حركة أخلع على النقيض تنادي بأن التجنيد حرام مستنده على حديث لرسول الإسلام يقول فيه يكون في آخر الزمان أمراء ظلمة و وزراء فسقة و قضاة خونة و فقهاء كذبة، فمن أدرك منكم ذلك الزمان فلا يكونن لهم جابيا ولا عريفا ولا شرطيا. الحركة الجديدة تمثل نقيضا فكريا لحركة لا للتجنيد الإجباري. فبينما يؤمن أفراد حركة لا للتجنيد الإجباري بالسلامية و رفض حمل السلاح، يستخدم أعضاء حركة أخلع صورا و شعارات مؤيدة للدولة الإسلامية بسوريا و العراق، بالأضافة لصور زعيمها أبو بكر البغدادي. و بينما تدعم حركة لا للتجنيد الإجباري خطابا متصالحا مع الغرب و إسرائيل، تنتهج أخلع خطابا معاديا للغرب و إسرائيل. في 1 يناير 2015، أعلنت حركة أخلع عن أول ضابط يستجيب لدعوات الحركة و يترك الخدمة بالجيش المصري. المقدم تامر بدر أصدر بيانا يقول فيه أن أستقالته من الجيش المصري كات بسبب رفضه لسياسة قيادات الجيش تجاه الثورة، و كذا لأنه لا أستعداد لديه لتوجيه سلاحه تجاه المصريين. و قد كان تامر بدر قد سُجن لفترة تزيد عن العام و النصف بعد مشاركته في تظاهرة عسكرية بميدان التحرير في 8 أبريل 2011. متى يبدأ التغيير؟ منذ كتب كريم عامر مقالاته المناهضة للتجنيد في 2006، لم ينجح الجيش المصري في فرض الخدمة العسكرية على أي رافض للخدمة العسكرية. كل من رفضوا التجنيد الإجباري تم أعفاؤهم من الخدمة العسكرية بعد أن دفعوا ثمنا ليس بهين، و لكنه أهون من الثمن الذي يدفعه الجنود المصريين بسيناء. الجيش لم يحاكم أي سلامي مصري بسبب رفضه لحمل السلاح. أصبح من الواضح أن الجيش يتجنب ما يمكن أن يكون أول محاكمة لمعترض ضميري في تاريخ مصر. تنازل الجيش المصري عن موقفه المتشدد المتمسك بنظام التجنيد الإجباري ليس إلا مسألة وقت. تاريخيا، كل الجيوش تمسكت بنظام التجنيد الإجباري. و لكن منذ نهاية الحرب العالمية الثانية، بدأت الجيوش تخضع لقيم الحداثة و الأحترافية. الجيش الأمريكي قبل بإنهاء نظام التجنيد الإجباري عام 1973. الجيش الفرنسي قبل بنفس الشئ عام 1996. الجيش الألماني قبل بذلك مؤخرا في 2012. و الجيش المصري سيضطر يوما ما للقبول بنظام تجنيد أحترافي بدلا من النظام الحالي. السؤال الحقيق ليس أذا ما كان الجيش سيتنازل عن موقفه المتشدد، و أنما متى سيتنازل عن موقفه المتشدد؟ الأجابة على هذا السؤال ستعتمد على عدد الشباب المصري الذي سيرفض الخدمة العسكرية علنا في السنوات القليلة المقبلة.

#fullpost{display:inline;} بعد أستقلال الصومال عام 1960، كان العديد من الصوماليون يحلمون بالديموقراطية. آنذاك، أنتشرت في الصومال العديد من التنظيمات الديموقراطية، و مرت الدولة بتداول سلمي للسلطة أكثر من مرة. إلا أن أحلام الصوماليين بالديموقراطية أنتهت مع أنقلاب الجيش في 1969، و الذي أسس لحكم عسكري دموي أستمر لمدة 21 عام. الأتحاد السوفيتي و الدول الناطقة بالعربية أختاروا أن يدعموا الدكتاتورية الجديدة، و أختار العالم أن يتعامى على جرائم تلك الدكتاتورية. في عام 1991، من خلال ثورة مسلحة تمكن الصوماليين من خلع الدكتاتور العسكري محمد سياد بري. و لكن، كما يحدث في معظم الأنظمة الجديدة، أختلف الصوماليون على شكل الدولة الجديدة، و من هنا بدأت حرب أهلية طاحنة لاتزال دائرة حتى اليوم، و إن كانت خفت حدتها. الصومال اليوم تتصدر قائمة الدول الفاشلة، قتل فيها نصف مليون شخص في الحرب الأهلية، و تشرد منها مليون لاجئ يعيشون في الدول المجاورة، بالأضافة إلى مليون و نص شخص مشرد داخليا. الحكومة الصومالية لا تسيطر على معظم الأراضي الصومالية، بل أحيانا بعض أجزاء من العاصمة مقديشو تخرج عن سيطرتها. فشل السلطات الصومالية في أدارة البلاد سمح للقراصنة الصوماليين بممارسة جرائمهم في البحر، و للقاعدة و غيرها من التنظيمات الإرهابية في إنشاء معسكراتها في البر. الصراع العسكري الدائم و المجاعات و اللاجئين و الأرهاب، كلها قضايا جعلت الديموقراطية في مؤخرة أولويات السلطات الصومالية و المجتمع الدولي. الحركات الديموقراطية في الصومال كانت هي الضحية الكبرى لكل ما حدث في الصومال منذ أنقلاب 1969. تعرضت تلك التنظيمات للقمع 21 عاما على يد الدكتاتورية العسكرية وسط صمت العالم، و مع بداية الحرب الأهلية أصبح الديموقراطيين هدف للعسكريين و الإسلاميين في نفس الوقت. الحرب لأهلية جعلت للرشاش قيمة أعلى من صندوق الأقتراع. و حتى اليوم فأن ما يشغل العالم، ليس الديموقراطية، بل أقامة سلطة قوية في الصومال تسيطر على الامن و تسترجع اللاجئين. مع أن الصومال لن تستقر إلا بنظام ديموقراطي توافقي ينهي الصراع. لكن الصوماليين لم يدفعوا وحدهم ثمن عدم الأستقرار في وطنهم، بل معظم دول القرن الأفريقي بل و حتى الدول الكبرى. ففي عام 1977 غزا العسكر الصوماليين أثيوبيا ضمن أحلامهم التوسعية. و مع الحرب الأهلية، بدأ العالم يدفع فواتير للتدخل العسكري أكثر من مرة إما لحفظ السلام و إما للتخلص من الحركات الإسلامية المسلحة، و فواتير الأنفاق على ما يقرب من مليون لاجئ صومالي هربوا من الحرب الأهلية و أرهقوا الدول المجاورة أقتصاديا، و فواتير مكافحة القراصنة الصوماليين و تأثيرهم السلبي على التجارة في غرب المحيط الهندي، و فواتير مكافحة الحركات الأرهابية التي أصبحت الصومال أحد بؤرها. الحقيقة أننا كلنا شاركنا، بشكل أو بآخر، في دفع فاتورة عدم وجود ديموقراطية مستقرة في الصومال. بعد أسقاط الدكتاتور محمد حسنى مبارك في مصر، أختلف المحللون أن كانت مصر ستسير وفقا للتجربة التركية حيث يسيطر الجيش على الأمور العسكرية و يحمي عالمانية الدولة بينما يسمح بحكومة منتخبة ديموقراطية، أم التجربة الأيرانية حيث نجح الإسلاميين في السيطرة تماما على الجيش و أجهزة المخابرات و أخضاعهم، أم التجربة الباكستانية حيث تقاسم الجيش و الإسلاميين السلطة و لكن على أرضية ثيئوقراطية و ليس عالمانية كتركيا. في الحقيقة، أن مصر لا تسير في طريق تركيا أو أيران أو حتى باكستان. حتى يونيو الماضي كانت المؤشرات تقول أن مصر تسير طبق النموذج الباكستاني في تقاسم للسلطه بين الجيش و الإسلاميين على أساس ديني، إلا أن أنقلاب 3 يوليو نقل مصر من النموذج الباكستاني للنموذج الصومالي من حيث وجود صؤاع لا نهائي بين العسكر و الإسلاميين. ففي مصر، الديموغرافيا و البطالة تجعل الأحتجاجات الشعبية مأزق لا مفر منه، و تدهور الأقتصاد جعل الكعكة صغيرة جدا بحيث لا تسمح بالقسمة بين العسكر و الإسلاميين، و تفكك الدولة المصرية جعل الصراع الداخلي بين أجهزة المخابرات المصرية المختلفة أشبة بالحرب الأهلية. و كما حدث في الصومال، يتم سحق الحركة الديموقراطية المصرية بين مطرقة الجيش و سندان الإسلاميين. فالدكتاتورية العسكرية قمعت الديموقراطيين لأكثر من ستون عاما، في الوقت الذي تبنت فيه أفكار الإسلاميين جاعله الشريعة الإسلامية مصدرا للتشريع و سمحت خلالها بمزايا نسبية للإسلاميين. و بعد وصول الإسلاميين للسلطة، أستمر الأخوان المسلمين في سحق الحركة الديموقراطية المصرية و سجن و نفي أفرادها. و بعد أنقلاب يوليو 2013، عاد الجيش ليصادر الحريات الفردية و العامة تحت أدعاءات محاربة الإرهاب. و بعكس الإسلاميين، لا يتمتع الديموقراطيين في مصر بدعم أي دولة أجنبية. فأدعاءات الأتحاد الأروربي و الولايات المتحدة بدعم التحول الديموقراطي في مصر لا تزيد عن كونها بروباجاندا سياسية في الوقت الذي تقوم فيه تلك الدول بتمويل و تسليح الدكتاتورية المصرية. لقد أصبح واضحا أن الأمور في مصر لن تسير للأحسن. القمع الغير المبرر الذي يستخدمه الجيش المصري ضد الأخوان المسلمين، و خصوصا الأطفال منهم، جلب لهم المزيد من التعاطف. و من المتوقع أيضا أن يخلق الدستور الجديد أنقساما مضاعفا، فالعالمانيين لن يقبلوا بالنصوص الدينية في الدستور، ولا الديموقراطيين سيقبلون بالسلطات التي منحها الدستور الجديد للجيش. الضغط الدولي على مصر دفع الدولة للبحث عن داعم بين دول الخليج و روسيا و الصين. الوضع الأقتصادي المتردي قد يقود لمجاعات و فوضي. الأقليات المسيحية و الشيعية قد تتعرض أيضا لمذابح و للتهجير. و من غير المستبعد أن يلجأ الجيش المصري لإلغاء معاهدة السلام مع إسرائيل، كوسيلة لأستخدام الأيديولوجية القومية في القمع الداخلي، و لإيجاد مبرر لتجنيد ملايين الشباب الذين يشاركون في التظاهرات بشكل دوري، و لأبتزاز العالم من جديد للحصول على ثمن جديد لتوقيع أتفاقية سلام جديدة مع إسرائيل. الأقتصاد و عدم الأستقرار السياسي، مع ضعف سيطرة الدولة على الحدود، سيدفع بمئات الألوف و ربما الملايين من اللاجئين لشواطئ أوربا. حينها التدخل العسكري الأجنبي في مصر لن يكون مستبعدا. في بداية القرن الماضي، كانت ألمانيا مصدر لعدم الأستقرار في أوربا، و تسببت في حربين عالميتين و مذابح راح ضحيتهم أكثر من 100 مليون شخص. لم تستقر أوربا إلا في عام 1949 بصدور الدستور الألماني موقعا من الدول الغربية المنتصرة في الحرب العالمية الثانية. هذة القوى ذاتها أختارت ألا تبني في الصومال ديموقراطية مثل ألمانيا، تاركة أياها مصدر لعدم الأستقرار في القرن الأفريقي، و يبدو أن هذة القوة ستكرر نفس الخطأ تاركة سوريا مصدرا لعدم الإستقرار في منطقة شرق المتوسط. للأسف، مصر لن تستقر إلا أذا أتفقت نفس القوى مضافا إليها القوى الأقليمية كالسعودية و إسرائيل على خريطة طريق لدمقرطة مصر. هذا و إلا ستدفع تلك الدول ثمنا كثمن عدم أستقرار ألمانيا و الصومال. تم نشر أجزاء من هذا المقال باللغة العربية على موقع CNN بالعربية Posted by Maikel Nabil Sanad at 4:34 p.m. Labels: Articles

L’esercitazione coinvolge 33 Stati, ed è ospitata nei poligoni, nelle basi navali e negli aeroporti militari di Portogallo, Spagna e Italia. La fase preparatoria dell’esercitazione è cominciata da tempo, mentre dal 3 Ottobre ci troviamo in una fase di “simulazione” e organizzazione dei comandi. La fase operativa a fuoco avrà inizio il 21 ottobre e proseguirà sino al 6 novembre, i centri principali in Italia saranno il comando JFC di Lago Patria (Napoli), il poligono di Capo Teulada in Sardegna e l’aeroporto di Trapani Birgi in Sicilia (che sarà affiancato da altri cinque aeroporti militari: Sigonella, Decimomannu, Amendola, Pratica di Mare e Pisa-Grossetto). È uno scenario che richiede uno sforzo di consapevolezza e la volontà di agire. Riteniamo sia necessario continuare ad opporre alle attività militari, per tutta la durata dell’esercitazione, comprese le fasi preparatorie, iniziative e mobilitazioni contro la guerra, le sue strutture, la sua economia, la sua celebrazione (come quella del 4 di novembre) e contro la presenza della NATO, da attuarsi ovunque possibile. In Europa molte sono state e, a breve, saranno le iniziative e le mobilitazioni contro la TJ015, da Cagliari a Napoli, da Marsala a Saragozza. Nell’ambito di questa ampia mobilitazione la rete No Basi Né Qui Né Altrove si propone di agire il 3 Novembre su uno dei principali teatri di guerra in Italia, il poligono di Capo Teulada, dove è previsto il bombardamento delle flotte NATO contro la costa sarda, lo sbarco di reparti anfibi italiani, USA e del Regno Unito, lo schieramento di reparti di terra che si dispongono a sparare, bombardare e distruggere con ogni tipo di armamento disponibile. Ci presenteremo, come sempre, con l’obiettivo di inceppare la macchina bellica ed ostacolare lo svolgimento dell’esercitazione, solidali con tutte le altre realtà di lotta antimilitarista ed antimperialista che si preparano a fare altrettanto. Ripetiamo il nostro appello ad agire sui luoghi della guerra, possibilmente negli stessi giorni, sia per accrescere l’efficacia dell’azione sia per rendere più chiara la volontà generale e diffusa di opporsi e sabotare questo abominio.

Basta farsi una passeggiata in centro città, consigliata via Roma, per accorgersi di una presenza militare spaventosa nella nostra città. La zona del molo Ichnusa ospita quattro enormi navi da guerra, che definerle inquitanti è un complimento. Le navi sono sorvegliate dalle forze dell’ordine italiche a terra e da militari armati di mitra a bordo. Le vie del centro sono un continuo via vai di macchine, mezzi, pullman, pulmini, camion militari. La zona delle caserme del poetto e di Sant’Elia è in continuo fermento. Abbiamo la guerra in città. Purtroppo i nostri concittadini non sembrano più di tanto disturbati dall’essere circondati da noti assassini di tutto il mondo, per alcuni tutto questo pare pure una “figata”, infatti sono in molti che vanno al porto a farsi i selfie con le navi militari sullo sfondo.

180,"CONTRIBUTO DI MORAS – MOVIMENTO RESISTENZA ANTICAPITALISTA SARDEGNA SUL CAMPEGGIO ANTIMILITARISTA E SUL CORTEO DELL’11 OTOBRE","2015-10-18 00:00:00",NoBordersard,null,"CHI VIVE DI GUERRA NON VA LASCIATO IN PACE! Il campeggio antimilitarista che si è svolto a Cagliari il 9-10-11 ottobre è stato organizzato dalla rete No Basi Né Qui Né Altrove per rilanciare le lotte antimilitariste che da ormai un anno e mezzo circa hanno luogo in Sardegna. La scelta di Cagliari non è stata casuale: la città infatti è tra le più militarizzate d’Italia anche se questa presenza dei militari ormai non viene quasi notata, perfettamente mimetizzata nel contesto urbano e le ditte che collaborano a vario titolo con l’apparato bellico sono ignorate dai più. Per questo motivo sono state compiute delle azioni informative sia per sottolineare i legami tra il mondo dell’università e il mondo militare che per evidenziare la diretta connessione tra banche ed economia della guerra, mettendo in evidenza il nesso fortissimo tra civile e militare. Durante la tre giorni ci sono state diverse assemblee, la più importante sicuramente è stata quella di sabato 10, in cui è stato presentato il calendario delle esercitazioni degli ultimi mesi del 2015 e sono state condivise le esperienze antimilitariste di persone che venivano da altre lotte non sarde. Durante le assemblee sono state prese anche delle decisioni sulle prossime tappe della lotta antimilitarista in Sardegna, soprattutto in vista della Trident Juncture, l’enorme esercitazione Nato che coinvolge Portogallo, Spagna e Italia, in particolare Sicilia e Sardegna. L’atteggiamento repressivo della polizia si è abbattuto particolarmente su compagne e compagni che venivano da fuori: sono stati dati ben 12 fogli di via. Durante il campeggio sono stati compiuti vari atti intimidatori, come ad esempio il taglio delle ruote alle auto dei partecipanti al campeggio. Le tre giornate antimilitariste si son concluse col corteo in diverse vie di Cagliari. Un gruppo di un centinaio di compagni si è mosso intorno alle 19 da Piazza d’Armi per proseguire verso il centro. Il corteo si è subito caratterizzato dagli slogan antimilitaristi e qualcuno pro Palestina vista la concomitanza delle giornate di dolore che stanno vivendo i fratelli palestinesi. Già da subito gli sgherri del controllo sociale hanno mostrato la loro invadenza con teleobiettivi e video sorveglianza. Appena il corteo si è mosso hanno subito stretto a tenaglia i manifestanti con una presenza massiccia e assurda, da grandi occasioni, con tanto di elicottero (nuovo fiammante) della polizia che ha sorvolato il centro cittadino per quasi tutta la giornata. Durante il corteo sono apparse scritte di rabbia contro la guerra e i suoi servi, contro la sudditanza del nostro territorio con i suoi 30 mila ettari di servitù militari, dove proprio in questi giorni sono intenti ad esercitarsi i mercenari di mezzo mondo. La presenza delle cosiddette forze dell’ordine si è fatta sentire sempre più asfissiante durante il tragitto del corteo, ma i compagni proseguivano con la loro determinazione senza lasciarsi intimorire dalle divise di Stato. Arrivati all’altezza di una banca un gruppo di manifestanti ha voluto mettere in evidenza l’intreccio tra il potere economico e finanziario europeo con la guerra imperialista, lanciando qualche oggetto e vernice rossa; rossa come il sangue dei proletari che subiscono gli artigli di questo connubio e il tutto è bastato per sguinzagliare le divise con una violenta carica a freddo sulla parte finale del corteo che comunque è riuscita a tenere la posizione. Da quel punto in poi del tragitto, il corteo ha subito diversi attacchi, con alcuni compagni pestati violentemente ma che con orgoglio e determinazione proseguivano col far sentire l’odio verso la logica del potere asservita alla guerra, che gli sgherri col manganello hanno contribuito a rafforzare. Dopo qualche mezz’ora di tafferugli, slogan e ancora scritte, i compagni hanno deciso di disperdersi ognuno con la propria “storia”. La giornata di domenica è un altro tassello importante per la lotta antimperialista in Sardegna e non solo, che proseguirà sempre più attiva e con il sorriso fra le labbra rivolto verso chi crede di fermarla con qualche foglio di via e qualche manganellata, convinti sempre di più che chi vive di guerra non va lasciato in pace.

182,"Comunicato del Cagliari Social Forum sul corteo antimilitarista dell’11 ottobre a Cagliari","2015-10-16 00:00:00",NoBordersard,null,"Cagliari blindata e cariche della polizia Ancora una volta la polizia carica pacifici manifestanti. Apprendiamo dalla stampa (L’Unione Sarda del 12 ottobre c.a.): “Si sono ritrovati con l’obiettivo di urlare il proprio no alle basi militari e di dare vita a un’assemblea popolare sul tema” ma “il corteo è stato caricato per due volte dalle forze dell’ordine”. Apprendiamo che Cagliari (zona storica) è stata messa sotto assedio con interi quartieri blindati e isolati, con punti, ritenuti nevralgici dalla polizia, presidiati, con elicotteri che sorvolavano la città. Scenari inquietanti e preoccupanti, ben lontani da quelli che dovrebbero rappresentare una società basata sul rispetto dei principi democratici. Può bastare una mancata comunicazione della manifestazione alla questura e qualche scritta sui muri per giustificare questa vergognosa violenza e questa violazione dei basilari diritti dei cittadini e delle persone? Leggiamo ancora: “a mettere in allerta le forze dell’ordine la presenza di alcuni stranieri “professionisti” della contestazione”.E ancora: “c’era il timore, rivelatosi infondato, che i manifestanti potessero lasciarsi andare a qualche episodio di violenza”. Ci chiediamo, con seria preoccupazione, se chi decide di assediare la città, se chi ordina le cariche su pacifici manifestanti possa avere la paranoia come ispiratrice del proprio operato. Ci chiediamo: quale è il costo, in termini economici e a carico della collettività, di questo imponente spiegamento di mezzi e di persone? Quale è la vera finalità? Supposto fosse vera (e di questo ne dubitiamo) la presenza di alcuni “professionisti” della contestazione, se contestare è urlare slogan contro le basi e contro la guerra, se contestare è opporsi alle ingiustizie e alla distruzione della propria terra, ci auguriamo che tutta la popolazione sarda acquisisca tale professionalità. Se una mancata comunicazione alla questura per una manifestazione contro le basi e contro la guerra è una violazione tale da giustificare il vergognoso comportamento dei responsabili dell’ordine pubblico, che dire della illegittima e costante violazione dell’art.11 della costituzione? Se qualche scritta sui muri è grave reato che dire della guerra permanente imposta alla popolazione sarda da diversi decenni e che ha portato alla distruzione del territorio e grave danno alla salute delle persone? Che dire del violento impatto ambientale che avrà sulla Sardegna la tanto sbandierata “grandiosa” esercitazione TRIDENT JUNCTURE ancora una volta imposta? Condanniamo quindi l’operato dei responsabili dell’ordine pubblico ed esprimiamo piena solidarietà ai manifestanti di cui condividiamo obiettivi e operato.

Comunicato Antimilitariste e Antimilitaristi sul campeggio e il corteo antimilitarista a Cagliari","2015-10-15 00:00:00",NoBordersard,null,"Nonostante la pioggia, Ottobre è un mese caldo. Le mobilitazioni si stanno susseguendo su vari fronti aperti nella città di Cagliari e sul territorio: Antifascismo, Antimilitarismo, Movimento di lotta per la casa, Supporto alle lotte dei migranti e contestazioni studentesche. La rete no basi né qui né altrove, dopo un anno di mobilitazioni antimilitariste in Sardegna, ha lanciato una campagna di iniziative che è partita il 3 ottobre con la giornata No War – No border in solidarietà alla resistenza delle frontiere in Italia e in Europa. Ha proseguito con l’organizzazione del campeggio antimilitarista in vista della mobilitazione contro l’esercitazione Trident juncture, la più imponente esercitazione NATO degli ultimi 15 anni. Programmata dall’alleanza, prevede una intensissima stagione di esercitazioni e addestramenti anche in Sardegna, dove avverranno pesanti bombardamenti di aria, mare e terra con le conseguenze devastanti per il territorio e per la salute che qui già ben conosciamo. Questa esercitazione si inserisce nella strategia generale di riarmo e sviluppo di nuovi strumenti aggressivi intrapresa a partire dal vertice NATO tenutosi in Galles a settembre 2014, con la progettazione di nuove guerre e altri morti. In risposta a questo fermento, è emersa chiaramente la volontà delle forze repressive di soffocare qualsiasi forma di opposizione. Le misure adottate dalla forza pubblica prima, durante e dopo il campeggio antimilitarista che si è svolto il 9,10,11 ottobre a Cagliari, sono state un’avvisaglia di come intenda gestire il “problema” di chi lotta contro l’esistente. Sono sopraggiunte diverse richieste di sorveglianza speciale per gli attivisti della rete no basi, i compagni venuti in Sardegna in solidarietà alla lotta antimilitarista sono stati accolti in aeroporto con fogli di via preventivi, avvisi orali, perquisizioni e controlli. Una impressionante militarizzazione del centro della città ha preceduto e accompagnato la 3 giorni del campeggio. Oltre alle operazioni di routine, siamo stati oggetto di azioni intimidatorie degne dei più squallidi film sui gangster: gomme squarciate, minacce verbali e mai troppo velate richieste di collaborazione. Il momento culminante dell’operazione portata avanti dall’apparato poliziesco è stato il corteo della domenica organizzato dal campeggio, di seguito un resoconto. Breve racconto di una carica, manifestazione antimilitarista a Cagliari, domenica 11 ottobre 2015 La manifestazione è partita regolarmente da piazza d’Armi verso le 19, in una zona universitaria che di domenica sera è poco popolata. Il corteo è stato subito seguito da un nutrito gruppo di agenti DIGOS-ROS cui si sono aggiunti quasi subito i reparti celere e poi anche i carabinieri in assetto antisommossa, che comunque si sono limitati a seguirci per tutto viale Merello e viale Fra’ Ignazio e poi in Corso Vittorio Emanuele. Mano a mano che ci avvicinavamo alle zone più centrali e trafficate della città, si poteva però notare come l’atteggiamento degli agenti stesse diventando più aggressivo e nervoso, mentre si avvicinavano sempre più alla coda del corteo, che aveva raggiunto un centinaio di persone. Quando abbiamo imboccato via Mameli, che ci avrebbe portato nel largo Carlo Felice e in piazza Yenne, è partita quasi subito una violenta carica alle spalle del corteo, cui poi ne sono seguite altre. L’atteggiamento degli sbirri era contraddittorio, da una parte ci intimavano di scioglierci, dall’altra rendevano impossibile lo scioglimento incalzandoci da dietro e schierandosi a bloccare l’uscita della stessa via Mameli nella quale ci trovavamo. Evidentemente avevano l’ordine di non farci raggiungere il centro della città (largo Carlo Felice e piazza Yenne) in quel momento affollato di persone. In qualche modo, nonostante le cariche, il corteo è proseguito sino a piazza del Carmine, dove si è potuto finalmente fermare, ricompattarsi, per poi sciogliersi. Le forze del dis-ordine a quel punto si sono lanciate in un’ultima ridicola esibizione di forza e di stupidità, lanciandosi (secondo loro) all’inseguimento dei manifestanti che andavano sciogliendosi. Abbiamo assistito all’arrivo di sei furgoni carichi di agenti antisommossa all’imboccatura di via Sardegna, dove gli agenti sono scesi, poi in gran fretta gli sbirri hanno formato una doppia schiera e si sono lanciati in una carica… in mezzo al nulla, tra i tavolini dei bar e la gente impaurita ma anche allibita che li sbeffeggiava. Nonostante l’aggressività e i pestaggi, siamo riusciti a non subire né feriti gravi né arresti. Il giorno dopo tutte le scritte, vecchie e nuove, che si trovavano lungo il percorso della manifestazione, erano state cancellate dalla squadra imbianchini della questura, mentre erano ancora visibili le macchie prodotte nella facciata della sede della Croce Rossa Italiana, in viale Merello (la C.R.I. risulta coinvolta nella manovra militare Trident Juncture2015, come organizzazione collegata alla NATO). Hanno provato ad intimidirci, nascondono le tracce del dissenso con la paura che la mobilitazione si allarghi sempre di più perchè sanno che i poligoni sardi e non solo, producono impoverimento e morte. I nostri obiettivi restano chiari e le iniziative continueranno come da programma. La migliore risposta è continuare a lottare!

Miliardi di euro vengono spesi per trattenere queste persone e poi espellerle, verso i Paesi dai quali erano faticosamente e onerosamente partite. Molti di questi soldi pubblici finiscono nelle tasche delle organizzazioni “umanitarie” che hanno accettato di gestire i CIE, ben sapendo che i dispositivi fondamentali sui quali questi non-luoghi sono costruiti sono gli stessi che hanno caratterizzato i campi di internamento storici, compresi i lager nazisti. Le frequenti manifestazioni di disagio dei reclusi nei Centri non lasciano dubbio alcuno sulle condizioni di vita al loro interno. E, d’altra parte, chiudere in gabbia delle persone che si spostano nel mondo non sembra in ogni caso una risposta accettabile. Questo libro vuole aprire una riflessione seria e non ideologica sull’istituzione CIE e invita ciascuno di noi a confrontarsi con la propria personale responsabilità riguardo alla loro esistenza.

I soccorsi della guardia costiera ritardano di quasi un’ora. Si salveranno solo in 155, soccorsi dai pescatori presenti sul posto, gli altri affogano a poche centinaia di metri dalla spiaggia, il numero esatto non si saprà mai. La strage diventa purtroppo una occasione per passerelle di politici e ipocriti discorsi di circostanza, utili solo a coprire e giustificare proprio quelle politiche criminali che sono all’origine della strage stessa. Da quel 3 Ottobre 2013, in un Mediterraneo sempre più militarizzato, si susseguono missioni militari per il controllo delle migrazioni (Mare Nostrum, Triton e ora EuNavForMed) e imponenti esercitazioni della NATO (l’ultima, la Dynamic Manta è appena terminata a Settembre, e incombe già la Trident Juncture 2015, dal 21 Ottobre al 6 Novembre). In un crescendo osceno, le ondate migratorie e le stragi vengono usate per giustificare gli interventi militari, il saccheggio delle risorse locali, la distruzioni di intere società, eventi che a loro volta sono all’origine delle ondate migratorie e delle stragi. Abbiamo scelto il 3 Ottobre 2015, a due anni esatti dalla strage, non per una semplice rievocazione di quell’evento tragico. Vogliamo che sia l’occasione per un confronto vivo, e dedichiamo perciò l’intera giornata al tema delle migrazioni e della guerre, per affrontare insieme questo nodo che strangola le nostre vite, per spezzare una volta per tutte questo sanguinoso e infernale meccanismo.

Tre richieste di sorveglianza speciale, fogli di via, avvisi orali e tante visite poco simpatiche ai domicili dei compagni e delle compagne per notifiche e denunce. Una lunga estate calda ha preceduto la dipartita del questore Filippo Dispenza salpato non verso i verdi pascoli, ahinoi, ma verso la sua carriera da inquisitore su livelli piu’ alti. Ci si confronta sul tema della repressione, si organizzano feste e presidi solidali e si continua a lottare contro un’esistente che non ci piace e che riteniamo ingiusto e disuguale. Questo continuare a lottare è la risposta migliore anche al di là di sentenze positive di giudici che non riconosciamo senz’altro come “amici” o paladini della democrazia fasulla dei tribunali. Il quadro che danno questi tentativi di repressione è però tutt’altro che roseo. In una situazione di palese impotenza delle forze di polizia nell’arginare la rabbia e il disagio, il ministero degli interni cerca una via comoda e parsimoniosa per congelare chi gli sta in qualche modo scomodo. Così si inaspriscono e si allargano le applicazioni di misure previste per criminali organizzati, si intensifica il controllo e si cerca un tribunale compiacente per avviare un nuovo corso della repressione mirato all’auto controllo con osservanza di tutta una serie di limitazioni che sviliscono l’essere umano rendendolo carceriere di se stesso. Teramo, Trento, Cremona per citare altre delle città in cui questa pratica questurina si è diffusa cercando, con i mezzi subdoli del potere, di dettare una condotta per assopire in qualche modo le lotte e farle arenare, magari sulle derive democratiche che tanto piacciono ai politicanti. Un tentativo tra i tanti per limitare l’orizzonte di chi vede, anche se a volte troppo lontano, il tramonto del potere e l’alba di un esistente migliore. Ma senza l’oste, si sa, i conti sono sempre sbagliati, e se il tentativo è limitare i nostri orizzonti con barriere e filo spinato, con frontiere e CIE, con punizioni e galere forse si sono dimenticati che noi guardiamo sempre oltre quell’orizzonte e che oltre c’è sempre la libertà per tutte e tutti. Quindi “cari”inquisitori noi continuiamo a macinare strada verso quell’orizzonte, e non sarete certo voi e la vostra carta straccia a fermarci.

L’esercitazione coinvolgerà 30 Stati, 36.000 militari, 60 tra navi e sottomarini, 140 tra aerei ed elicotteri; si svolgerà per tutto il mese di ottobre fino al 6 novembre 2015 e sarà ospitata da Portogallo, Spagna e Italia. Un teatro di guerra “simulata” che, a partire da Gibilterra e dal Mediterraneo occidentale, si proietterà verso sud e verso est. L’esercitazione si articolerà in due fasi: – dal 3 al 16 ottobre attività di pianificazione strategica, che coinvolgeranno esclusivamente i centri di comando, denominata Command Post Exercise (CPX). – dal 21 ottobre fino al 6 novembre, fase operativa vera e propria (indicata con livex) nei poligoni, nei porti e negli aeroporti militari degli Stati ospitanti e nelle acque e nei cieli dell’Oceano Atlantico e del Mar Mediterraneo. È uno scenario che richiede uno sforzo di consapevolezza e la volontà di agire. Riteniamo sia necessario opporre alle attività militari, per tutta la durata dell’esercitazione, comprese le fasi preparatorie, un mese di mobilitazioni ed iniziative contro la guerra, le sue strutture, la sua economia e la presenza della NATO, da attuarsi ovunque possibile. Nell’ambito di questa ampia mobilitazione proponiamo inoltre, a tutte le realtà di lotta antimilitarista ed antimperialista: una giornata di azione simultanea sui teatri della guerra “simulata”, da attuarsi durante la fase Live, prevista dal 21 ottobre al 6 novembre, con l’obiettivo di inceppare la macchina bellica ed ostacolare lo svolgimento dell’esercitazione. come fermarla L’azione sui luoghi della guerra nel corso di una stessa giornata ne potenzierebbe senz’altro l’efficacia, visto che impedirebbe di riorganizzare le esercitazioni e renderebbe più chiara una volontà generale e diffusa di opporsi e sabotare questo abominio. È certamente un obiettivo molto ambizioso, che richiede un grande sforzo di intelligenza, di immaginazione e di organizzazione: dallo studio accurato delle attività previste, alla scelta della data più opportuna per attuare la mobilitazione, sino a immaginare e costruire concrete azioni di disturbo da realizzare sul campo. In questo particolare frangente una mobilitazione antimilitarista diffusa e simultanea potrebbe essere estremamente efficace. Puntiamo all’ambizioso obiettivo di chiudere ovunque, finalmente e in via definitiva questi luoghi sciagurati di morte. Questa proposta della rete NoBasi NeQuiNeAltrove si inserisce nel percorso antimilitarista intrapreso lo scorso autunno in Sardegna. Le pratiche proposte con continuità negli ultimi tempi, nel loro insieme, hanno raggiunto l’obiettivo di disturbare la presenza militare attraverso iniziative di controinformazione, rallentamenti dei convogli, ripetute invasioni dei poligoni e blocco delle esercitazioni. Questo è il contesto da cui è nata la necessità e la voglia di organizzare un mese di mobilitazioni contro la presenza e l’occupazione militare nel nostro territorio e di proporre una giornata d’azione simultanea contro l’esercitazione NATO Trident Juncture 2015. La storia dei movimenti di opposizione alla guerra negli ultimi decenni mostra chiaramente come, per fermare la macchina bellica, non sia sufficiente orientare la cosiddetta “opinione pubblica” ed esercitare pressioni su autorità politiche. La prima, anche quando è largamente maggioritaria, rischia di essere irrilevante, le seconde sono sempre pronte a facili promesse e rapidi voltafaccia. Esperienze molto recenti, come quella del movimento No-MUOS in Sicilia, dell’opposizione ai radar di sorveglianza costieri, della lotta contro l’occupazione militare in Sardegna, ci raccontano come il coinvolgimento personale degli individui in azioni di controinformazione, di resistenza e di sabotaggio della macchina bellica possano portare a risultati tangibili e concreti. Se, d’altra parte, se guardiamo al passato e al resto del mondo, non mancano esempi di lotte simili per il metodo e anche superiori per efficacia.

CAMPEGGIO ANTIMILITARISTA DI LOTTA – DINTORNI DI CAGLIARI 9-10-11 OTTOBRE 2015 Dalla mobilitazione contro il poligono di Capo Frasca del 13 settembre 2014, le iniziative e le azioni dirette contro la presenza militare in Sardegna si sono moltiplicate e diversificate per provare ad inceppare il meccanismo della guerra. Tagli delle reti, rallentamento dei mezzi e blocco delle esercitazioni hanno tolto la “necessaria serenità” allo svolgimento delle attività militari. Forti di questa esperienza e sulla scia del corteo dell’11 giugno 2015 a Decimomannu, come Rete No Basi né qui né altrove abbiamo deciso di indire per il secondo fine settimana di ottobre un campeggio di lotta antimilitarista. Questi tre giorni vogliono continuare ed affinare le forme di lotta praticate fino ad ora, con l’obiettivo di sabotare l’apparato militare e tutto ciò che ci gira intorno. Per questo ci piacerebbe una partecipazione attiva e un contributo da parte di tutti e tutte, che possa poi essere spunto per una riproducibilità delle pratiche nei propri contesti e territori. Il campeggio inoltre vuole fare da trampolino di lancio per la mobilitazione internazionale, chiamata per la seconda metà di ottobre, contro l’esercitazione Trident Juncture 2015. Con questa esercitazione la NATO intende testare la sua forza di intervento sul breve periodo, preparandosi ai sempre più probabili conflitti sui fronti mediorientale, nordafricano e russo. 36000 uomini, centinaia di mezzi, aerei e navi spareranno in Sardegna , Sicilia, Spagna e Portogallo. Per questa esercitazione, la più grande dal 2002, la NATO impone ancora una volta il suo tributo in termini di inquinamento, sfruttamento di risorse e militarizzazione dei territori per allenarsi alla guerra. Così come è stato per le esercitazioni della brigata Ariete, della brigata Aosta e la STAREX, non possiamo renderci complici di tutto questo, non facciamoli stare tranquilli.

197,"Esercitazioni militari in Sardegna: a settembre scatta Trident Juncture la più grande esercitazione NATO dal 2002, proviamo a vedere cos’è.","2015-08-18 00:00:00",NoBordersard,null,"La Trident Juncture viene varata a Dicembre 2014, gli alti vertici NATO parlano di un’esercitazione con più di 25.000 uomini, impiegati fra Italia, Spagna e Portogallo. Il periodo stabilito è l’inizio dell’autunno 2015, da fine Settembre al 16 Ottobre con la sistemazione logistica e la fase simulata, fino al 6 Novembre con la fase live. Lo scopo principale dell’esercitazione dovrebbe essere la creazione di una forza di intervento rapido, da sommare a quella già esistente composta da circa 35.000 uomini. Il 3 Giugno, a pochi giorni dal corteo di Decimomannu contro la Starex, esce la notizia che la Trident subirà una modifica dal progetto originale, non sarà più ospitata anche dalla Sardegna perchè “per operazioni di tale portata non sussistono le condizioni per operare con la sufficiente tranquillità”, le esercitazioni aeree previste a Decimomannu vengono dirottate a Trapani. La preoccupazione di una deputata trapanese produce un’interrogazione parlamentare (16 Giugno) alla quale la ministra della difesa Pinotti risponde confermando il piano originale che vedeva coinvolta anche la Sardegna, ed evitando la chiusura al traffico civile dell’aeroporto di Trapani. Questo dietrofront viene reso pubblico dalla stampa sarda l’1 Agosto, che inoltre precisa una connessione fra la T.J e l’esercitazione Mare Aperto, il che vuol dire fuoco dal mare e dal cielo a Teulada nella seconda metà di Ottobre. La Trident sarà guidata dalla nuova base NATO di Lago Patria a Napoli, secondo le più recenti fonti giornalistiche vi parteciperanno 36.000 soldati, più di 200 aerei e almeno 50 navi. Lo scopo non dichiarato ma abbastanza palese è quello di preparare la guerra alla Russia e migliorarsi ancora di più in fatto di guerra preventiva. La militarizzazione del mediterraneo sarà impressionante. Ecco come la presenta la NATO. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f_w3MWbm-U Proviamo a capire quale sarà il ruolo dei poligoni sardi: le mobilitazioni dell’ultimo anno hanno indotto i vertici militari ad andare cauti nel divulgare informazioni sensibili, addirittura hanno scelto a Giugno di scaricare la tensione del corteo contro la Starex con la favoletta dello spostamento dalla Sardegna della Trident. A Gennaio ritardarono il più possibile l’uscita pubblica del calendario delle esercitazioni del primo semestre 2015 e così ora stanno facendo per quelle del secondo e per la Trident. Non avendo in mano questi documenti si può immaginare consultando i calendari degli scorsi anni cosa succederà tra Ottobre e Novembre, infatti non è il primo anno che a Teulada si svolge la Mare Aperto.. Inoltre un’esercitazione di questa portata non può chiaramente rimanere nascosta, quindi ecco che frugando su internet si trova molto materiale (tra cui l’interessante conferenza stampa di presentazione) da cui si possono estrapolare interessanti informazioni, come ad esempio la partecipazione di organizzazioni umanitarie non governative, di cui però i generaloni, nonostante l’enfasi con cui ne parlano, non rivelano i nomi…. In ogni caso trattandosi di un esercitazione che prevede principalmente l’uso di aerei e navi da guerra si può affermare con buona sicurezza che l’aeroporto di Decimomannu e il poligono di Teulada saranno protagonisti assoluti dell’esercitazione. Teulada lo sarà nella seconda metà di Ottobre, quando, come già detto, decine di navi da guerra di mezzo mondo si disporranno al largo delle sue coste per bombardamenti di ogni tipo. Per Decimo è più difficile ad oggi intuire in quale periodo ci sarà più movimento sulle piste, ma è anche più facilmente controllabile e udibile visto che difficilmente il rombo di decine di cacciabombardieri passa inosservato. Quindi un orecchio al cielo, un occhio al mare e uno al computer per capire il prima possibile le mosse del nemico. Mobilitiamoci, Non facciamoli stare tranquilli. Nonostante la quantità di notizie circolanti in rete non è facile fare una descrizione approfondita sulla Trident Juncture, questo articolo vuole essere un primo contributo per stimolare l’informazione e un confronto anche in vista delle prossime iniziative antimilitariste. Non può quindi avere pretese di completezza o esattezza, in merito a questo ogni contributo è ben gradito.

Le misure di prevenzione sono delle limitazioni delle libertà personali basate sulla presunta pericolosità sociale dei prescelti. Le richieste della questura sono di due anni di sorveglianza. Fatta di rientri notturni, firme, divieto di soggiorno in provincia di Cagliari, ma anche limitazioni nel lavoro, non poter frequentare luoghi pubblici (quali bar, locali, stadi..), manifestazioni, assemblee e pregiudicati. Queste richieste si stanno diffondendo in tutt’Italia, per adesso però non stanno avendo successo, tutte le ultime richieste di sorveglianza sono state rigettate dai giudici. In queste settimane una bellissima solidarietà è stata vicina ai compagni colpiti e a tutte le realtà indirettamente minacciate.

209,"Deliri di Sorveglianza","2015-07-06 00:00:00",NoBordersard,null,"Deliri di Sorveglianza Come anticipato qualche giorno fa, il 2 luglio la questura di Cagliari ha notificato una nuova richiesta per la sorveglianza speciale per un altro compagno. Da un anno le questure di tutta Italia provano ad imporre questo provvedimento, fino ad ora con scarsi risultati: tutte le udienze svolte ad oggi si sono concluse negativamente, per loro. E positivamente per noi. Purtroppo non demordono nell’intento, sperando di trovare un giudice compiacente che assecondi questo delirio, perché di delirio si tratta: per sua natura, la sorveglianza speciale è un escamotage giuridico che mira a reprimere la persona non perché colpevole di qualche reato specifico, ma per il modo in cui conduce la sua vita. E’ un delirio, perché i fondamenti di tale richiesta poggiano sulla stesura di un profilo psicologico che comprende le attitudini e le scelte di vita, anche quando queste non sono contestabili come reati. E’ un delirio, perché agli stessi comportamenti contestati corrispondono differenti richieste di restrizioni, costruite ad arte di modo da colpire ciascuno nelle proprie abitudini. Il concetto di ”soggetto socialmente pericoloso”, su queste basi, sarebbe applicabile a chiunque provi a costruirsi una dimensione vivibile in un mondo di merda. La nostra risposta è continuare a lottare, perché se sorvegliarne uno è attaccarci tutt*, figuratevi due!

210,"In Sardegna i test del primo drone d’attacco europeo","2015-07-05 00:00:00",NoBordersard,null,"Nella base aerea sarda di Decimomannu è giunto nei giorni scorsi il primo prototipo di robot-killer volante nEUROn, l’aereo senza pilota da combattimento (Ucav – Unmanned combat aerial vehicle) coprodotto da Italia, Francia, Svezia, Spagna, Svizzera e Grecia. Il velivolo è stato trasferito in Sardegna direttamente da Istres, la base militare francese utilizzata dal gennaio 2012 per i test di volo del nuovo drone europeo. A Istres sono stati messi a punto i sensori ottici e i sofisticati sistemi a infrarossi del nEUROn e sono stati rilevati e analizzati i segnali elettromagnetici rilasciati dal drone in modalità stealth (scarsa visibilità ai radar). Adesso le attività sperimentali per il raggiungimento della piena operatività del velivolo proseguiranno nel grande poligono militare di Perdasdefogu (Ogliastra). Il nEUROn è il primo aereo europeo da combattimento a pilotaggio remoto dotato di materiali con accentuate caratteristiche stealth che gli consentiranno di penetrare nello spazio aereo nemico senza essere individuato. Il drone è più grande di un normale aeromobile Ucav e possiede capacità di carico, autonomia e capacità di volo quasi simili a quelle di un qualsiasi caccia pilotato. Con un costo unitario superiore ai 25 milioni di euro, il nEUROn è lungo 9,2 metri e ha un’apertura alare di 12,5 metri. Il velivolo può raggiungere la velocità di 980 chilometri l’ora e volare per più di otto ore consecutive. Opererà a tutti gli effetti come una spietata macchina-killer per colpire e uccidere a distanza grazie agli ordigni di precisione per gli attacchi aria-suolo a guida laser da 250 kg, che saranno trasportati in volo nel vano bombe interno. Il drone verrà controllato da terra attraverso il datalink ad alta capacità STANAG 7085, con standard Nato. “Tramite questo datalink vengono inviati al velivolo i dati della missione, da lì in poi sarà l’intelligenza artificiale del nEUROn ad intraprendere tutte le necessarie azioni che permetteranno il raggiungimento dell’obiettivo”, spiegano le aziende produttrici. “Non vi sarà quindi un controllo diretto e continuo da terra e questo permetterà di mantenere un quasi assoluto silenzio radio, necessario per evitare l’intercettazione”. Il drone avrà inoltre le capacità di controllare a distanza, in modo automatico, le operazioni dei cacciabombardieri di ultima generazione prodotti in Europa, come il “Rafale” e il JAS 39 “Gripen”, consentendo così ai piloti d’intraprendere diverse azioni di combattimento contemporaneamente. Per il programma nEUROn sono già stati investiti 400 milioni di euro. Ad esso partecipa in qualità di capofila con una quota del 50% il consorzio francese composto da Dassault Aviation, Thales e EADS-France. Ci sono poi l’italiana Alenia Aermacchi (Finmeccanica) che contribuisce da sola al 25% dei costi del pòrogetto, la svedese SAAB, la spagnola EADS-CASA, la greca EAB e la svizzera RUAG. Alenia Aeronautica, nello specifico, cura la progettazione e la costruzione dell’impianto di generazione e distribuzione elettrica, del sistema dei dati aria e del sistema automatico d’individuazione e ricognizione dei target da colpire (Smart Integratd Weapon Bay – SIWB).Tale sistema consente automaticamente l’individuazione ed il riconoscimento del bersaglio, la trasmissione della richiesta di approvazione al comandante della stazione di terra e il lancio dell’armamento. Un’altra controllata Finmeccanica, Selex Galileo, fornirà i sensori ottici integrati “IOH”. Da Decimomannu i tecnici di Alenia parteciperanno alle prove di volo del dimostratore e all’uso delle armi aria-terra nel poligono di Perdasdefogu. dal blog di Antonio Mazzeo http://antoniomazzeoblog.blogspot.it/2015/04/in-sardegna-i-test-del-primo-drone.html (function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window); Mi piace: Mi piace Caricamento...

214,"Cosa succede?","2015-06-28 00:00:00",NoBordersard,null,"Commento soggettivo di alcuni fatti recenti. Arriva l’estate, arriva luglio, arriva la pausa estiva delle esercitazioni, tutto fermo? Per niente. Questa settimana si sono incontrati i vertici militari e il Comipa (comitato misto paritetico) per firmare il programma delle esercitazioni per il prossimo semestre, non è andata benissimo. I rappresentanti del Comipa hanno abbandonato la sede del comando militare non firmando il documento. Per chi non se lo ricordasse erano anni che il Comipa non firmava i calendari delle esercitazioni proposti dai militari i quali passavano la palla al ministero della difesa che con un decreto imponeva lo stesso calendario per motivazioni di importanza strategica nazionale. L’anno scorso invece il Comipa ha firmato, in cambio di misere concessioni dei militari su qualche giornata in meno di fuoco e accordi vari di controllo su svolgimento e bonifica delle esercitazioni. Il risultato è stato che i militari hanno comunque finito di sparare dopo i termini stabiliti, non hanno concesso ai rappresentanti del Comipa di assistere alle esercitazioni e alle bonifiche così come accordato, e ora minacciano che se non ci sarà la firma al nuovo calendario chiuderanno le spiagge dei poligoni aperte ai turisti per la pausa estiva. Insomma prepotenza bella e buona. Purtroppo non si hanno notizie su quanto sarà fitto il calendario, se veramente la “Trident Juncture” sarà spostata a Trapani e se ci saranno altre grandi esercitazioni militari, sicuramente il rifiuto così netto del Comipa dopo l’apertura degli scorsi mesi fa pensare che non sia cambiato niente. Qualcosa invece sta probabilmente cambiando, almeno per quanto riguarda l’aeroporto di Decimomannu. Un paio di giorni prima del corteo dell’11 Giugno l’AMI si era esposta dicendo che aveva deciso di annullare la STAREX perchè “non sussistevano le sufficienti condizioni di tranquillità per svolgere esercitazioni di quella portata”. La giornata dell’11 gli ha dato ragione. E a non essere tranquilli ci sono anche i militari tedeschi, che gestiscono l’aeroporto insieme all’AMI, che dovrebbero investire tra poco 15 milioni di euro per ammodernare gli hangar e una delle due piste, e stanno chiedendo certezze sulla stabilità della struttura. Gli altri a non essere tranquilli sono i sindaci della zona, in particolare quello di Decimoputzu, che aveva convocato per il 18/6 un corteo “a favore delle esercitazioni e dei poligoni militari”, prontamente annullato dopo la montagna di critiche, spostato al 26, successivamente spostato di nuovo e trasformato in un’assemblea che si svolgerà lunedì 29, grossomodo dal titolo “difendiamo l’economia del territorio, difendiamo i posti di lavoro civili dell’aeroporto”, con questo cambiamento nella chiamata l’audace sindaco di Decimoputzu è riuscito a coinvolgere anche i sindaci di San Sperate, Villasor e Decimomannu, difficile prevedere cosa possa uscire da un’assemblea del genere, sicuramente è un segno di preoccupazione di una parte delle comunità che vivono intorno all’aeroporto, quelle che ci campano, quelle che campano sulla guerra. In mezzo a tutto questo bel movimento alcuni partiti indipendentisti non trovano niente di meglio da fare che riproporre, con più grinta del solito, un referendum consultivo (quindi assolutamente inutile ai fini legali) sulla presenza militare in Sardegna. Una strategia tagliagambe per i movimenti di lotta di base, un chiaro percorso propagandistico pre-elettorale di gruppi che parlano di percorsi di lotta che non hanno mai fatto e che hanno in questo progetto solo dei tornaconti personali.

Per il 30 giugno è stata richiesta un’udienza per la sorveglianza speciale per un compagno. La sorveglianza speciale(Legge n. 1423 del 27 dicembre 1956) e’ un provvedimento di limitazione della liberta’ basato sul codice Rocco e attualmente viene utilizzato per restringere il campo di azione di persone che secondo le forzate segnalazioni e chiacchiere poliziesche “mettono in pericolo l’ordine sociale” . Viene storicamente assegnata a figure di particolare interesse per la giustizia come elementi della criminalità organizzata o figure legate allo spaccio di droga. In momenti di particolare conflitto sociale viene estesa anche agli antagonisti politici come in questo caso. Gli ipotetici reati contestati vanno dall’antifascismo, alla lotta contro le basi militari, passando per cortei studenteschi, lotta contro i CIE, iniziative di solidarietà al movimento NOTAV, presidi sotto il carcere. Vengono citati “pericolosi” contatti con realtà anarcoinsurrezionaliste del nord italia e con il movimento NOTAV. La richiesta di questo provvedimento ben si inserisce nel progetto di criminalizzazione del dissenso portato avanti in Sardegna, come nel resto d’Italia. Appena il livello delle contestazioni si è alzato in ambiti diversi, la questura ha risposto con provvedimenti ad hoc per tenere a freno le realtà di opposizione. Sono sempre in numero maggiore le città dove la polizia ha adottato questa strategia : Cremona, Saronno, Torino, Bologna, Genova dove per ora sono state tutte rifiutate, ed ora Cagliari. Il neo-questore Dispenza con i suoi sgherri, togati o meno, si inserisce perfettamente in tutto questo con le sue interviste e le sue posizioni da Superman della legge, implacabile con i migranti così come con gli ultras e gli antagonisti. La nostra risposta a tutta questa logica e’ l’istinto alla rivolta contro un esistente che non vogliamo e che non merita altro che la sovversione. La nostra risposta a questi provvedimenti e’ continuare a lottare, con sempre maggiore determinazione contro questo stato di cose.

Il Re è nudo La vita è breve Viviamo per rovesciare i Re. Compagne e compagni —————————————————————————————— Il 30 giugno si terrá un’udienza per la richiesta di sorveglianza speciale per un compagno da anni attivo nel Coordinamento Antifascista Cagliaritano. Tra le varie accuse mosse per giustificare la sorveglianza speciale vi è quella di essersi contrapposto ad alcune realtá neofasciste. Per questo esprimiamo tutta la nostra complicitá e solidarietà. Ma ad uno sguardo più attento è la stessa sorveglianza speciale a meritare la nostra attenzione in qualitá di antifascisti e antifasciste. Si tratta infatti di un provvedimento destinato non a chi ha commesso qualche reato, ma a chi è considerato pericoloso per l’ordine pubblico. Il provvedimento prevede una serie di limitazioni della libertá personale richieste ad hoc dalla questura che possono essere estremamente invasive: dal divieto di frequentare determinate persone, locali pubblici come bar, discoteche, circoli privati e altri locali affini, passando per il divieto di esercitare attività imprenditoriali e commerciali, sino al divieto di partecipare a pubbliche riunioni. Non è un caso che questo provvedimento giudiziario abbia le sue origini all’interno del “Codice Rocco”, la legislazione del ventennio. Spesso abbiamo dichiarato che il nostro scopo è combattere il fascismo nelle sue molte forme, per questo il 30 giugno ci saremo: la sorveglianza speciale non è altro che fascismo di stato.

A Decimomannu la lotta l’abbiamo fatta tutti. Giovedì 11 giugno a Decimomannu un corteo determinato è riuscito ad arrivare fino alle reti dell’aeroporto militare, a costo di confronti anche duri con le forze dell’ordine. Non eravamo tantissimi, circa 200 persone, ma tutti compatti e concentrati sull’obiettivo di raggiungere le reti e dare un forte segnale, nonostante i 12 km di corteo sotto il sole cocente e in mezzo alla polvere e alle sterpaglie. I principali giornali sardi, impreparati di fronte a una reazione di questo tipo, dal momento che loro portano avanti continuamente una campagna di giustificazione della presenza delle basi in Sardegna, hanno iniziato a delirare sulla presenza di infiltrati del blocco nero provenienti dalla penisola. C’erano persone provenienti dal Continente, compagni e fratelli che lottano contro le grandi opere o le basi militari nelle loro regioni, ma nessun infiltrato e nessun membro del blocco nero. Tutti quanti i partecipanti al corteo hanno condiviso la scelta di affrontare i manganelli della celere pur di arrivare fino alle reti, e chi si mette a volto coperto lo fa per tutelarsi da ritorsioni legali e personali. La prima carica della polizia è arrivata a freddo su un gruppo di manifestanti a volto scoperto e mani nude e ha avuto, come risultato la testa spaccata di un compagno di Cagliari. Nervosismo e paura, questa l’aria che si respirava tra le forze dell’ordine, che non si aspettavano minimamente un corteo così compatto nella scelta di resistere alle cariche e nel perseguimento dell’obiettivo. Giovedì a Decimo non è stata messa in scena la classica rappresentazione del conflitto, giovedì il conflitto è stato reale. Certo, i numeri devono crescere, ma questo è stato un piccolo passo in avanti verso la formazione di un movimento ampio e popolare di lotta contro le basi, libero da una gestione politico-istituzionale. A DECIMOMANNU C’ERAVAMO TUTT*! ——————————————————————————————— COMUNICATO DI ALCUNE PARTECIPANTI A proposito della manifestazione dell’11 giugno contro le basi e delle notizie diffuse da alcune reti televisive (RAI3, Sardegna1 e Videolina). Noi eravamo presenti. E’ stata una manifestazione partecipata, pacifica e gioiosa anche se disturbata dal continuo volteggiare di elicotteri che ci ronzavano intorno e dalla presenza eccessiva ed opprimente della polizia. Arrivati nei pressi della base notiamo la presenza di un numero rilevante di poliziotti in tenuta antisommossa, pronti all’attacco. Ci chiediamo se in uno stato democratico una pacifica manifestazione possa essere intimidita e minacciata dalla presenza di un esercito in assetto di guerra! Arrivati alla recinzione della base un gruppo di manifestanti poggia le mani sulla rete e urla slogan contro le basi. E’ a questo punto che avviene l’inimmaginabile. La polizia si avvicina minacciosa e ‘a freddo’ carica, in uno scenario incredibile: i poliziotti si scatenano a picchiare, minacciare e manganellare; noi impotenti urliamo “vergogna!” “Picchiatori” “perchè attaccate una manifestazione pacifica?”etc.., sconvolti da tali fatti e molto arrabbiati per la brutalità e violenza cui assistevamo. Loro continuano a picchiare! Noi urliamo a voce sempre più alta e vola anche qualche pietra, senza peraltro raggiungere l’ obiettivo e con il palese intento di bloccare tanta violenza. In un attimo siamo stati tutti circondati e contemporaneamente si è scatenata la caccia ai pochi che tentavano di avvicinarsi nuovamente alla recinzione della base. Alcuni manifestanti avevano l’intento di aprire varchi? Non lo sappiamo e comunque non è rilevante e non ci interessa. Chi era presente ha visto violenze solo verso i manifestanti e i contusi e feriti sono stati tra noi; dopo di che si è scatenata la rabbia. Ma il nostro sdegno non finisce qui! purtroppo conosciamo quale è spesso l’agire delle “forze dell’ordine”. E’ stato ancora più bruciante,seguendo i vari notiziari dell’ 11/06, sentire notizie false e tendenziose: c’erano più di 100 blackbloc venuti da non so dove; le forze di polizia sono state aggredite; tra le forze di polizia 11 contusi (ma dove erano? Noi abbiamo visto solo manifestanti feriti!) e, come conclusione, un elogio della professionalità della polizia ed un ringraziamento per aver scongiurato una strage!! I vari servizi non sono accompagnati da alcuna ripresa sulle cariche della polizia e nessun giornalista o fotografo delle vostre reti, che ci risulti, era presente. Quindi come potete asserire che i poliziotti sono stati aggrediti e, grazie a loro, si è scongiurato un grave pericolo? E’ forse “democrazia” criminalizzare il dissenso diffondendo notizie false? E’ forse “alta professionalità” manganellare pacifici manifestanti? Appare evidente quale sia stata la fonte ‘unica’ delle vostre notizie. Siamo molto indignate. Vergognatevi. Rosalba, Dina e Pierluisa ——————————————————————————————— COMUNICATO DEL FRONTE INDIPENDENTISTA UNIDU “I manganelli italiani non fermeranno il riscatto della Sardegna” Il Fronte Indipendentista Unidu ha partecipato questa mattina al corteo lungo la base militare di Decimomannu, indetto dalla rete “No basi né qui né altrove”. Abbiamo verificato come le preoccupazioni fossero più che fondate: lo spostamento delle esercitazioni autunnali con lo strumentale zuccherino dello Stato è stato negli ultimi giorni finalizzato allo stigmatizzare la lotta contro l’occupazione militare agli occhi dell’opinione pubblica e, al contempo, allentare la tensione in vista del corteo a Decimomannu. Dopo gli ambigui comunicati dell’Aeronautica, le menzogne su esercitazioni inventate dai sardi – al contrario si tratta di una base militare in piena, impattante e redditizia attività – abbiamo assistito alla chiusura del cerchio. I manifestanti hanno subito un attacco gratuito da parte delle forze di occupazione italiane schierate a difesa della Base. Non è nostra intenzione attirare il pietismo del popolo o dello Stato colonizzatore e ribadiamo che la cultura del manganello italiana si è mostrata per quello che è, per gli interessi che persegue e dobbiamo prendere coscienza che non può essere diversamente. Sappiamo che questo trattamento è inevitabile verso chi si oppone all’imbruttimento del nostro Popolo, all’occupazione militare del territorio, anche con un semplice scuotere le reti a mani nude. Denunciamo l’attacco dello Stato e richiamiamo il nostro Popolo alla massima attenzione e mobilitazione, consapevoli che se la reazione dello Stato è tale, significa che la via intrapresa è quella giusta. Il Fronte Indipendentista Unidu ribadisce massimo sostegno alla lotta contro l’occupazione militare e rispedisce al mittente la repressione; esprimiamo solidarietà al manifestante fermato da parte della polizia. I manganelli italiani non fermeranno il riscatto della Sardegna Fronte Indipendentista Unidu ——————————————————————————————— PENSIERI DI UNA PARTECIPANTE Ricordo il giorno in cui le mie maestre di scuola elementare, nonché catechiste, portarono me e i miei compagni di classe “in gita” all’officina della guerra, la base militare di Decimomannu. Vai di walkman, marsupio, fonzies e felicità, da bere mi sa non ce n’era bisogno perché ce l’avrebbero offerto i militari. Ero piccola, forse in quinta, perciò 10 anni, in classe avevo il fiocco rosso e il grembiule tutti giorni, tranne il giorno della gita. D’altro canto si stava andando in una base militare, quindi eravamo liberi perfino di vestirci come volevamo. Ricordo poco, solito giochetto della memoria, cancella delle cose e ne conserva altre. Ho in mente la macchina fotografica usa e getta che avevo comprato per conservare nel tempo quella grande esperienza. Avevo fatto tante foto, una era con i miei compagni di classe, le maestre, i gerarchi militari e l’aereo dietro di noi, il tutto in un bello sfondo buio. Quel rullino l’avevo pure stampato e l’unica cosa romantica era il bianco e nero della foto. Ricordo che il mio migliore amico del tempo era impazzito di felicità e aveva detto di voler guidare gli aerei militari, per fortuna ora fa il miele e monta pannelli solari. Le maestre erano le stesse che si emozionavano quando mi sentivano ripetere la storia della caduta del fascismo in Italia, che nel sussidiario era il mio capito preferito. Un pò di confusione nelle menti dei formatori. I militari l’ho capito solo dopo cosa fossero. Torno alla base militare di Decimo ora, a 30 anni, proprio qualche giorno fa, 11 giugno. Anche stavolta ho qualcosa da portarmi appresso. Non più il walkman da ascoltare sola ma un furgoncino che spara musica per tutti, il marsupio è diventato uno zaino grande, i fonzies li ho sostituiti con dei panini e acqua molta acqua. Torno lì sempre coi miei compagni, che sono molti di più e stavolta la figata è che non ci sono maestre. Stavolta però i militari non ci hanno accolto e neppure fatto entrare dentro la base, nè offerto de bere, ci hanno caricato e aggredito. Stavolta non faccio la foto abbracciata ai militari, col cazzo, stavolta li guardo e ho la nausea, e odio tanto odio. L’educazione alla guerra con cui hanno provato a plasmarmi è servita solo a farmi crescere una forte necessità antimilitarista, etica prima di tutto e pratica poi. Ps: stavolta le foto mi sa che le hanno fatte loro, solo che stavolta nessuno li abbracciava… (function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window); Mi piace: Mi piace Caricamento...

L’udienza è fissata per il 30 giugno. Non abbiamo ancora vuto tra le mani le carte per capire a cosa si siano appigliati i questurini, sicuramente notiamo come la prassi di queste richieste vada diffondendosi su tutto il territorio italiano, dopo Torino, Genova, Saronno e Bologna ecco che ora è toccato a Cagliari. Seguiranno aggiornamenti, nel frattempo vi suggeriamo questo bel corto preparato dai compagni di Torino nella campagna di solidarietà agli otto compagni a cui è stata richiesta la sorveglianza. Aggiornamenti: Ieri mattina i questurini si sono presentati a casa del compagno per consegnarli il fascicolo inerente la richiesta della sorveglianza. La richiesta firmata dal questore Filippo Dispenza, è di due anni di sorveglianza, condita da rientro notturno, firme, divieto di frequentazione di pregiudicati, riunioni pubbliche, locali pubblici eccetera, in più hanno aggiunto il divieto di intraprendere attività commerciali cercando così di negare al compagno in questione la possibilità di mantenersi visto che il lavoro che normalmente svolge rientra in questa categoria. Gli ipotetici reati contestati vanno dall’antifascismo, alla lotta contro le basi militari, passando per cortei studenteschi, lotta contro i CIE, iniziative di solidarietà al movimento NOTAV, presidi sotto il carcere. Vengono citati “pericolosi” contatti con realtà anarcoinsurrezionaliste del nord italia e con il movimento NOTAV. Si sono dimenticati che ATTACCARNE UNO VUOL DIRE ATTACCARE TUTTI!

L’invasione del poligono di Capo Frasca, il 13 settembre scorso, ha rappresentato un momento importante di rilancio per questa pratica, una ripresa che ha contribuito a ottenere importanti risultati, come la riduzione delle giornate di bombardamento e l’annullamento o lo spostamento di tre imponenti esercitazioni militari internazionali. Questi recenti successi devono aver provocato non pochi pensieri e preoccupazioni alle autorità politiche e militari, e questo probabilmente spiega l’atteggiamento duro e provocatorio che la polizia ha tenuto nella giornata dell’11 giugno. Infatti il corteo è stato caricato appena pochi minuti dopo il suo arrivo alle reti dell’aeroporto. Di fronte alle aggressioni, alle provocazioni poliziesche, alle ripetute cariche e ai lanci di pietre da parte dei militari, i manifestanti hanno dato prova di grande dignità e determinazione resistendo a lungo, mantenendo la pressione lungo il perimetro della base e rifluendo tutti insieme. A questa bella giornata di lotta, cui hanno partecipato gruppi e individui da tutta l’isola e dal resto d’Italia, sono seguite dichiarazioni minacciose delle autorità di polizia, che parlano di “massacro” per poco evitato, arresti imminenti e vaneggiano di “infiltrati black bloc” spuntati nel bel mezzo delle campagne decimesi. Questo patetico tentativo di criminalizzazione non può fermare la volontà di liberazione che anima il nostro movimento né cambiare le nostre strategie perché chi vive di guerra non va lasciato in pace.

Continue colonne di mezzi dell’esercito attraversano la S.p.23, direzione: Zona del territorio denominata poligono di “PIAN DELL’ALPE”, area che viene occupata temporaneamente perché interessata da esercitazioni militari a fuoco con armi portatili. I valligiani ricevono l’ordine di non avvicinarsi grazie a continui comunicati murali che preannunciano le date prescelte. I pascoli come i sentieri vengono costantemente danneggiati dai cingoli e dall’abbandono di bossoli e spazzatura di varia natura. La montagna utilizzata come teatro di simulazione bellica per esercitazioni in condizioni “estreme”, viene così trasformata in uno spazio privo di vita a disposizione degli interessi dell’industria militare. Come spesso accade, si guarda al territorio alpino come semplice bacino da cui sottrarre spazio, risorse e da sfruttare a beneficio dei poteri forti, con buona pace dei suoi abitanti, la cui opinione, per loro non conta un fico secco.** Le deboli critiche mosse in passato da istituzioni locali come Comuni e Parco Orsiera-Rocciavrè, non hanno sortito il benché minimo risultato, ma ciò non ha impedito che continui se pur piccoli segnali di dissenso continuassero ad essere lanciati contro queste esercitazioni che militarizzano e avvelenano i territori e preparano le missioni neocolonialiste dell’esercito italiano in giro per il mondo. Sogniamo un mondo senza eserciti, e le vallate alpine in cui amiamo vivere ne sono parte. Non intendiamo disciplinare questa presenza, né tanto meno riciclarla come demenziale opportunità turistica, ma liberarcene definitivamente.

230,"25 Aprile, cronaca di una lunga giornata","2015-04-27 00:00:00",NoBordersard,null,"Cagliari, sabato 25 Aprile, ore 9 e 30, Piazza San Michele. Al concentramento del corteo indetto dal Coordinamento Antifascista Casteddu iniziano ad arrivare le persone, in contemporanea in centro città c’è la rappresentazione teatrale del corteo istituzionale, dove qualche esponente dei partiti di sinistra cerca di ridarsi un tocco di antifascismo…e dove come al solito sventola la bandiera biancoazzurra di Israele. Per la prima volta, da molto tempo, quest’anno Cagliari ha vissuto due cortei del 25 Aprile, uno istituzionale e uno autorganizzato, indipendente che ha scelto di partire da un quartiere popolare e di comunicare con esso non con la banda musicale, ma con volantini, speakeraggi e attacchinaggi, cercando l’interazione con quei segmenti di popolazione urbana più difficili da coinvolgere, dove spesso si annida quell’indifferenza sulle tematiche sociali, etiche e politiche che favorisce il dilagare dei luoghi comuni razzisti sui quali i fascisti continuano a lavorare da almeno cento anni. Più di centocinquanta persone verso le dieci e mezzo sono partite lungo Via Is Mirrionis, sicuramente molte meno di quelle che sfilavano sonnacchiose in Via Sonnino, ma onestamente chissenefrega. Fumogeni, cori, risate e attacchinaggi hanno accompagnato il corteo fino al cuore della città, in Piazza Carlo Alberto, dove sotto un caldo sole primaverile si è concluso il corteo che nel frattempo aveva aumentato le fila con l’arrivo di dormiglioni e ritardatari… Nel frattempo giunge la notizia ufficiale che alle 18.00 a Quartu si svolgerà la solita commemorzione fascista dei caduti della Repubblica Sociale Italiana, immediatamente si discute la notizia e ci si da appuntamento a Quartu per andare a disturbare i fascisti. A Quartu si ritrovano nel tardo pomeriggio diverse decine di persone, il centro della città è completamente militarizzato, camionette della Finanza, dei Carabineiri e della Polizia bloccano le vie di accesso a piazza Sant’Elena dove sono “rinchiusi” i nostalgici, in tutto più di cento uomini delle forze dell’ordine presidiano la zona, sono presenti tutte le alte cariche di DIGOS e polizie varie. Il corteo antifascista si sposta tutt’intorno alla piazza, trovando davanti a se sempre cordoni di celere già schierati, nel frattempo in piazza davanti a cinquantina braccia tese suona l’inno italiano. In una stradina laterale il corteo tenta un avvicinamento, volano uova di vernice, la polizia carica ritrovandosi però tra le gambe e stesse transenne che aveva disposto per chiudere la strada. Il corteo procede ancora, seguito dalla celere, i fascisti nel frattempo sono stati scortati fuori città dagli sbirri. Vengono lanciate uova su una banca e su una sede elettorale di Podeus. Poco dopo il corteo si scioglie. Mentre due compagni stanno tornando alla macchina la DIGOS li ferma, ne ammanetta uno e lo carica in macchina, scatta l’allarme, ci si ritrova e si va ad aspettare che il compagno venga rilasciato. Alle 21 circa esce dalla caserma di via Firenze con due denuce. La giornata finisce così.

232,"Racconto del corteo del 15","2015-04-22 00:00:00",NoBordersard,null,"Mercoledì 15, ci siamo ritrovati nel primo pomeriggio all’appuntamento, a pochi metri dalle reti del poligono di Teulada, in una cinquantina di persone. Con un piccolo corteo abbiamo raggiunto il primo dei cancelli della parte ovest del poligono, ad aspettarci c’era la DIGOS, celere, militari, jeep e perfino motociclette.. Arrivati davanti al cancello si è formato un presidio di alcuni dei manifestanti mentre altri hanno iniziato a sparpagliarsi lungo la recinzione, ben seguiti da DIGOS e Carabinieri all’esterno e dai militari all’interno, lungo il perimetro stazionavano a ogni chilometro mezzi della celere o della DIGOS, a complicare il tutto c’erano anche un notevole numero di api incazzate nere dal disturbo causato alla loro impollinazione. Visto il gran dispiego di forze messo in campo dalla questura di Cagliari il pomeriggio è proseguito senza grandi sussulti, all’interno del poligono la Brigata Aosta si esercitava in manovre di mezzi alzando un gran polverone visibile a chilomentri di distanza. I tentativi per sviare i pedinamenti degli sbirri sono andati tutti, o quasi, a vuoto. A differenza del 5 Dicembre, quando il superamento delle reti da parte di alcuni militanti causò il blocco delle esercitazioni, l’altro giorno ci siamo ritrovati contro un’organizzazone molto più efficace da parte degli sbirri che nonostante ciò, a detta di alcune lepri solidali con la lotta, non sono riusciti del tutto a impedire alcuni tagli alle reti. La giornata è proseguita fin verso le sei quando i manifestanti cotti dal sole, impanati dalla polvere e stufi di essere circondati dagli sbirri hanno deciso di andarsene. Sicuramente la giornata del 15 non si può considerare come un passaggio esaltante della recente lotta antimilitarista, però è chiaro che la pratica che abbiamo provato a mettere in campo è quella giusta, altrimenti non credo che la questura avrebbe mobilitato tutta quella sbirranza, d’altronde abbiamo ripetuto più volte quanto siano importanti strategicamente i poligoni sardi nei disgni di guerra italiani e non solo, quindi non c’è da stupirsi che le contromisure aumentino, sta a noi capire come renderle inefficaci. Un’ultima, ma non per questo poco importante, cosa da raccontare è la presenza per la seconda volta su due in questo punto del poligono, di pastori e pescatori locali, che hanno aggredito a parole e non solo, alcuni manifestanti. Questi idioti venduti allo stato e che vivono di elemosina, sono stati imbeccati dagli sbirri e si sono presentati in cricca a metà del pomeriggio a minacciare ritorsioni a chi si oppone al poligono, il tutto chiaramente protetti dalla DIGOS. Purtroppo non si finisce mai di scoprire la demenza umana dove può arrivare, questi sono quelli che si spacciano per pescatori (nel senso che si sono comprati una barca solo per poter fare richiesta), e così godono degli indenizzi statali per tutti i giorni dell’anno in cui non possono pescare perchè la parte del poligono a mare è attiva e quindi chiusa alla pesca. Oppure sono i pastori che hanno terreni e ovili attaccati alla base e mandano le loro greggi a pascolare dentro il poligono (una delle zone più inquinate d’Italia) tutto l’anno anche durante le esercitazioni, proprio come mercoledì scorso. Il ricatto che i militari fanno a queste componenti di popolazione è enorme, ma questo non li rende meno colpevoli e complici del disastro etico e ambientale che si svolge per nove mesi all’anno a Teulada.

E’ stata vista e segnalata e ha sbarcato lo stesso tipo di mezzi che erano arrivati sabato scorso per la Brigata Aosta che ha iniziato le esercitazioni il 1 aprile. Probabilmente i mezzi erano troppi e non è bastato un viaggio per trasportarli tutti. Sembra escluso che si tratti già della Brigata Garibaldi che subentrerà all’Aosta nel poligono di Teulada, perché non ci sono i mezzi pesanti, carri armati e altre amenità, che saranno usati a Maggio.

236,"Contributo su Immobilizziamoli di sabato 28","2015-03-30 00:00:00",NoBordersard,null,"IMMOBILIZZIAMOLI – 28 marzo 2015 – porto di Sant’Antioco Un racconto della giornata La “Nave gialla” Maior si è presentata puntuale, la mattina presto di sabato 28 marzo, nella rada del porto di Sant’Antioco. Alle 11 di mattina ha incominciato a sbarcare i mezzi, a mezzogiorno il piazzale del porto era pieno di autoblindo, veicoli blindati di vario tipo, container pieni di armi ed esplosivi. I numerosissimi mezzi, per essere spostati, devono viaggiare a piccoli gruppi, e formano quindi un gran numero di convogli che si susseguono lungo la strada. Gli autisti hanno incominciato da subito a spostare i mezzi e a formare i convogli diretti verso il Poligono di Capo Teulada, pare avessero una gran fretta. Infatti alle tre del pomeriggio i manifestanti hanno incominciato a radunarsi nel piazzale di fronte al porto e, mezzora dopo, in una cinquantina, hanno bloccato una colonna di mezzi blindati leggeri in uscita. Il blocco è durato una mezzora, guardato a vista da decine di poliziotti e carabinieri presenti, sia in divisa che in borghese, compresi digos vecchi e nuovi, dopodichè si sono aggiunti una trentina di poliziotti antisommossa, muniti di casco e scudo, che hanno incominciato ad avanzare dal fondo della colonna, dove erano rimasti sino a quel momento in disparte e sono venuti verso di noi, per farci arretrare. Ne è seguito un breve spingi-spingi, dopodiché le forze del dis-ordine, superiori come numero, hanno prevalso e hanno sfondato il blocco, facendo passare i mezzi. Dopo un altra mezzora si è formato un altro convoglio, di nuovo la massa dei celerini è avanzata verso i manifestanti, per aprirsi il passo. Questa volta però i manifestanti sono arretrati, fuoriuscendo dal piazzale del porto, nella strada statale, dove l’intervento della polizia risultava molto più difficoltoso, anche per la presenza degli allibiti automobilisti in transito, da e verso il paese di Sant’Antioco. Anche in questo caso però l’intervento massiccio delle forze del dis-ordine è riuscito a far passare i mezzi. La serata è proseguita poi con questo ritmo, con manifestanti e militari che cercano sempre nuove strategie: gli uni per rallentare e gli altri per far passare i mezzi. I militari hanno tentato di far uscire i mezzi dal secondo cancello del porto, per aggirare i manifestanti, che si sono di nuovo riversati sulla strada statale, inseguiti dai celerini, poi una parte dei manifestanti hanno provato a spostarsi in macchina lungo la statale, ma sono stati intercettati da pattuglie digos-carabinieri, circondati e trattenuti per ore, il tutto mentre le autoblindo della brigata Aosta uscivano dal porto, scortate dagli agenti antisommossa, in mezzo ai manifestanti che urlavano insulti ai militari, erti sulla torretta, allibiti… Complessivamente si può dire che l’iniziativa sia riuscita, il trasferimento dei mezzi dal porto al poligono è stato certamente reso più difficoltoso e anche notevolmente rallentato. Alle otto di sera, quando le operazioni di trasferimento si sono fermate, buona parte dei mezzi si trovava ancora nel piazzale del porto. Ma soprattutto abbiamo rotto ancora una volta il velo di silenzio plumbeo e rassegnazione che ha coperto per troppi anni il continuo avvicendarsi di reparti e di eserciti che vengono in Sardegna per combattere una guerra che non ha mai fine. uno che c’era (function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window); Mi piace: Mi piace Caricamento...
