0,1,Ukraine and the ‘New Cold War: The Return of Neutralism,2014-06-04 00:00:00,Matt Finucane,"Crimea, EU, Finland, Hungary, IMF, Neutralism, Obama, Poroshenko, Russia, Ukraine, Yugoslavia",-0.353554,ES,whether the crimean crisis heralds a new era of international relations (or not) it has clearly been a pivotal moment in russia’s relationship with the west the world over balances of power are shifting and though the united states remains unrivalled in sheer power close to the borders of rising china and the increasingly-assertive russia (each allegedly emboldened by obama’s vacillations in syria and ukraine) grey areas are emerging for those states most vulnerable to these ‘revisionist powers’ (those most alarmed by obama’s ‘hands-off approach’) the policy of ‘neutralism’ appears increasingly worthy of revival neutralism defined a cold war foreign policy pioneered by finland and later adopted by josip tito’s yugoslavia following his split with stalin in 1948 when geographically sandwiched between two antagonistic blocs neutralism prescribed balanced relationships with each side as such neutral states reaped rewards otherwise reserved for paid-up members of either bloc and enjoyed a modicum of security in knowing that both blocs considered their mutual neighbour’s neutralism preferable to its defection to the other side in this sense yugoslavia was archetypal tito’s split with stalin had been so volcanic that none foresaw rapprochement (one exchange featured tito imploring stalin to “stop sending people to kill me” then teasing his paranoia: “if you don’t stop sending killers” he wrote “i’ll send one to moscow and i won’t have to send a second”) yugoslavia’s ensuing isolation saw its economy decimated by a soviet embargo nevertheless seeing in yugoslavia a thorn in the flesh of communist unity its trade deficits were quickly soaked up and economy kept afloat by generous western loans with the balkan pact in 1953 yugoslavia became entwined with two nato members greece and turkey thus affording it some relief from the very real threat of soviet intervention without necessitating its formal nato membership from here a rapprochement with the new khrushchёv regime was possible and an ostensibly socialist yugoslavia prospered in the grey area between the messianic empires the lynchpin of neutralism was that both blocs needed an interest in the subject’s continued ‘independence; the crushing of hungary’s 1956 revolution (while the west looked elsewhere) was testament to the paucity of this circumstance therefore in ukraine where both russia and the west vie for influence it’s not surprising that president-elect petro poroshenko has already indicated a willingness to rekindle relations with russia and perhaps even limit ukraine’s military activities against its pro-russian ‘donetsk people’s republic’ in exchange for closer ties with vladimir putin if the commentary that abounded shortly after ukraine’s crisis began (and after russia and the west declared their implacable allegiance to opposing sides) is to be believed and a new cold war is truly on the rise then now more than ever a policy of neutralism offers intermediary states unique bounties there is little doubt now that ukraine will seek further european union integration—a definitive blow to russia’s eurasian economic union that will likely come into effect (without ukraine) in january 2015 economic stability is surely poroshenko’s primary interest and put simply the eu offers the best means to achieve that however while his west-leaning electorate would never countenance a rebalance towards russia an exclusive alliance with the eu and imf might similarly threaten the recovery agenda underpinning his presidency the imf has already warned that major reforms of the ukrainian economy will be necessary—a potential ‘unemployment nightmare’ and likely to hit ukrainians’ traditional energy subsidies—the period of austerity may well leave ukraine again relying on russia for stability—a gross irony considering the present bloodshed in the east having sworn to eliminate the insurgency in not two or three months but hours a long-foreseen concession on autonomy seems the likely means to defuse this situation this would be a victory for russia and pro-russians alike and putin recognises this—evident in his stated readiness “for a dialogue with petro poroshenko” where previously ukraine’s government was denounced as an illegitimate junta though some might decry this a surrender to a self-evidently nasty regime two problems (of which they’re likely aware) present themselves: none are willing to wage war over strategically-lukewarm ukraine; nor are any states eager to take full responsibility for its moribund economy with the weight of imf restructuring hanging heavily coupled with the threat of a russian gas cut-off to ukraine’s nascent government neutralism’s likely never looked so appealing ,fear,0.34045845,0.0588235294117647,0.1176470588235294,0.1176470588235294,0.1176470588235294,0.0588235294117647,0.3529411764705882,0.0,0.0588235294117647,0.0,0.0588235294117647,0.0588235294117647,0.0452127659574468,0.0101499423298731,care,fairnaess,0.3529411764705882,0.1176470588235294
1,2,Guest Post: China and the Crimea Conundrum,2014-03-12 00:00:00,Matt Finucane,"China, Crimea, Putin, Russia, Tibet, Uighurs, Ukraine",-0.177808,ES,with the eu-us alliance’s imposition of heavy sanctions on russia over its de facto annexation of crimea the world is now looking to russia’s perceived long-term strategic ally china to deliver a breakthrough in the diplomatic deadlock that has emerged between putin and the west while many analysts were expecting china to side with russia on account of their track record of un security council veto alignment or even because russian expansion might set a precedent for an eventual taiwan takeover so far beijing has issued a series of statements that can perhaps most aptly be described as non-committal above all else china has urged the involved parties to refrain from escalating the situation with violence stating that “the situation in ukraine is extremely complex” and that “an open attitude” is key to resolving the conflict indeed beijing’s diplomatic rhetoric in this unfolding crisis has been rather opaque hinting perhaps more than anything at a desire to ‘stay out of it’ – which would altogether be an understandable wish considering the already generous amount of political turmoil on beijing’s plate (eg last week’s north korean missile launches the uighur knife attack territorial tensions in se asia) meanwhile chinese newspapers known for their jingoist language and widely considered to be mouthpieces of the ccp have been less subtle: according to them the west is stuck in a “cold war mentality” exacerbating the situation with their threats of sanctions and overly bellicose language still all things considered china has generally kept a low profile throughout this crisis and doesn’t seem particularly eager to abandon its position of neutrality anytime soon even so china did allegedly publicly speak out against the russian incursion into crimea last week citing the necessity to respect ukraine’s “sovereignty and territorial integrity” as the reason for doing so this statement is concordant with beijing’s long-term pattern of categorically opposing any political measure that oversteps national boundaries recent examples of which are china’s unsc vetoes against military action in the libya and syria crises what the language of the chinese statements also closely mimics however (and what many analysts tend to overlook) is the chinese response to the russia-georgia conflict of 2008 which ended in russia declaring the pro-russia territories of south ossetia and abkhazia independent in 2008 china’s foreign ministry spokesperson qin gang stated: we have a knowledge of the complicated history and reality of the south ossetia and abkhazia issues in accordance with china’s consistent and principled stance on issues of this kind we hope the relevant parties can resolve the issue through dialogue and consultation replace ‘south ossetia and abkhazia’ with ‘crimea’ and this statement could have been issued just yesterday given their history china’s current stance thus really shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone still china’s insistence that territorial integrity should be respected appears to be at considerable odds with their own claims to several territories notably taiwan and the diaoyu/senkaku islands in the south china sea why then should we consider china’s gratuitous wilsonianisms as anything other than tu quoque fallacies and why should china even care about what russia does in the first place much less imperil their strategic cooperation with the fellow communist country by explicitly voicing their displeasure there are any number of discernable reasons as to why china could be irked over the crimea situation among them not wanting to sour trade relations with the west or even the$10 billion nuclear pact chinese president xi jinping signed with ukraine’s yanukovich on december 5 2013 which was part of china’s plan to establish a “nuclear umbrella” of its own realistically though trade relations with the west would probably not have suffered had china remained silent and the ousting of yanukovich — however convenient for putin — was not instigated by the kremlin the most important reason behind china’s subtle denouncement of putin’s move into crimea is most likely of a wholly different nature and can be explained by looking at russia’s treatment of the tatars of crimea last week big x’s suddenly started appearing on the front doors of many crimean tatars the indigenous muslim inhabitants of crimea the marks were left by gangs of kremlin apologists and they invoked a particularly nasty episode in crimean tatar history: in 1944 stalin had his police force carve x’s in the doors of crimean tatars after which they were promptly deported from the peninsula this time around the marks were left as a warning dissuading tatars — who post-stalin constitute only a small minority on the peninsula—from voting pro-ukraine in the upcoming referendum the tatars have responded in varying ways some fleeing crimea while others have banded together in groups to patrol their neighborhoods although it is not clear whether russian troops or rather civilians were the ones to mark the doors putin has done nothing to mitigate the resulting unrest among the tatars instead he has reiterated his line of protecting the ethnically russian majority of crimea on several occasions exacerbating ethnic tensions and indicating that the minorities simply aren’t of particular importance to him but they are to china much like in 2008 putin has fashioned the narrative underlying his expansionist maneuver into crimea on the basis of ethnicity rather than territory the reason why china objected to south ossetian and abkhazian independence then and is objecting to crimean independence now is not because it doesn’t set a precedent for uncontested expansion into historical territory – it is because it sets the wrong kind of precedent rather than paving the way for a chinese incursion into taiwan a territory to which china argues to have a historical claim it underlines and legitimates the political cleavages between ethnicities this runs directly counter to the ccp’s domestic policy which has historically been to nip all claims to independence made by ethnic minorities (of which over 55 exist in china) firmly in the bud – lest china go down the same road as the soviet union beijing has been very crafty in carrying out this policy using sanctions and even arranging mass immigrations of han chinese to minority-dominated areas to gradually dilute manifestations of minority culture but the administration nonetheless regularly meets with passionate resistance the most famous example of resistance to this policy of establishing a chinese monoculture is perhaps tibet but the uighurs – who reside in the xinjiang area – have been even more prolific in voicing their disgruntlement and the recent knife attack certainly shouldn’t be considered an isolated incident map of china by ethnic distribution a look at the above ethnic map of china immediately explains why the ccp is so determined about curbing ethnic tensions and keeping china unified: even though the ethnic minorities only make up about 9% of the chinese population they inhabit a large land mass of china – the most important parts of which tibet and xinjiang coincidentally have important strategic value the chinese are famously strapped for resources and as it turns out xinjiang is home to particularly large oil gas and mineral deposits xinjiang also has pipelines running through it that supply china with valuable oil and the region provides direct access to many resource-rich neighboring countries tibet on the other hand has valuable forest and fresh water resources to supplement their mineral deposits on which china as a whole is heavily dependent control of the tibetan plateau additionally represents political leverage in south east asia simply because of the fact that many of the rivers that run through neighboring countries originate there besides these resources the tibet and xinjiang regions also represent huge geopolitical benefits the two regions fence off china from india and the central asian countries and their rugged mountain ranges provide an additional layer of protection against potential military invasions from the outside from a trade perspective having control over tibet and xinjiang means having land routes to the persian gulf states which are among china’s main oil suppliers absent these china would be forced to open up more circuitous avenues of sea trade which are both more vulnerable and more costly all in all then china would suffer huge losses strategically financially and from a natural resources point-of-view if the tibetans and uighurs were to secure their independence and it is from this perspective that we should understand china’s domestic policy: the chinese have no option but to downplay the importance of ethnicity in crimea the chinese recognize yet another example of a state breaking down because of a dominant ethnicity claiming independence in one of its constituent regions and this is exactly the kind of precedent china is not willing to help set this article was republished with the kind permission of bradley tencate cc

4,5,Two Very Different Wars on Terrorism: How the Cold War Haunts Collaboration,2014-02-03 00:00:00,Matt Finucane,"Afghanistan, bombings, Chechnya, Doku Umarov, Волгограде, politics, Putin, Russia, Sochi, Syria, terrorism, Volgograd",-0.197037,ES,on the 29th of december at 12:40 moscow time an explosion gutted the entrance to volgograd’s central train station leaving eighteen dead and forty-four injured the explosion was recorded on cctv the shockwave rocking the camera while those civilians visible scatter from the blast the very next morning a trolleybus erupted in the dzerzhinsky district killing a further sixteen dead and leaving forty-one injured the latest of many attacks in russia’s recently turbulent past they—like most others—failed to pierce international consciousness in such a way as for example the (lesser) boston marathon bombings of april 2013 while the hashtag #prayforboston became a global phenomenon (and still bears regular recital) even on the days of the bombings tweets concerning volgograd hardly transcended the russian border[i] this represents no substantial divergence from the norm for while terrorist attacks on the west and its allies are neatly categorised as generic attacks on liberty itself attacks on russian soil take on a very different character immediate blame is attributed in this case to (speculatively dead) chechen islamist doku umarov; his motive: the recognition of the caucasus emirate as a state distinct from the russian federation comparatively while responsibility for the september 11th attacks was rapidly attributed to osama bin laden (an invasion force sallied forth weeks later) few have read his “letter to the american people” nor watched his 2004 al-jazeera tape in which his motives are clearly expounded a plethora is offered the most recurrent being: support for the state of israel and its part-genocidal invasion of lebanon the united nations sanctions against iraq (recognised as having caused not less than 400000 child deaths) and the supporting of various unsavoury regimes to maintain a steady flow of cheap materials that stumbling upon these well-published testimonies—upon which a fourteen-year war was predicated—evokes a similar feeling to unearthing some forgotten and long-sought document is a failure of not only the media but the system it inhabits the effect of obfuscating why the west was attacked while paying due attention when such terrors befall others rids us of the onus to address the grievances of the attacker this is not transnational victim-blaming cum hindsight that russians know of chechen aims and the 2007 declaration of the emirate has not muted president putin’s resolve—vowing soon after the volgograd attacks to “strongly and decisively continue the battle against terrorists until their total annihilation” what it might mean however is a retraction of the public support (call it acquiescence) to stumble blindly into wars that only aggravate the conflict such a blissful state must be considered a new phenomenon on both sides of the ‘war on terror’ for it was the second islamised chechen war—the catastrophic siege of grozny often likened to america’s own in iraq’s fallujah—that laid a firm basis for all subsequent attacks including those in volgograd and the ‘present’ promised putin “for the muslim blood that’s been spilled” while the united states promised to stand “in solidarity with the russian people against terrorism” few russians hold their breath it was with disbelief that the kremlin witnessed the toppling of iraq’s saddam hussein libya’s muammar gaddafi and now the attempt on syria’s bashar al-assad—three regimes that “stood in opposition to all types of islamic influence” toppled in the american war on terror it is the fear of an islamised greater middle east that drives russian foreign policy in the region though chechnya displays all signs of stability and recovery (a distinct difference to the recently recaptured fallujah) there is little doubt the rise of such an entity would disturb the delicate equilibrium—the bombings in volgograd are testament to the readiness of the militants should such an entity arise in some respects when it comes to the ‘global war on terror’ russia feels hard-done-by for the militants it fought in afghanistan in the late 1980s—those who would follow the soviet forces home—were in part trained by the united states just as the soviet union had (to a much smaller extent) armed the north vietnamese against the americans the cia provided training and arms (some of them state-of-the-art) to the mujahedeen in the words of national security advisor of the time zbigniew brzezinski to give “the ussr its vietnam war” that the repercussions of this would long outlast the cold war was a hallmark of the blinkered strategies of the era and though cooperation will always be difficult between two former enemies (indeed some say a new cold war’s already brewing) the classification of terrorist attacks on equal terms is a compulsory first step cc image courtesy of wwwvolganetru [i] волгограде = volgograd enjoyed it wed be grateful if youd share it: twitter facebook reddit tumblr more email pinterest linkedin google stumbleupon like this:like loading related tagged: afghanistan bombings chechnya doku umarov волгограде politics putin russia sochi syria terrorism volgograd posted in: matt finucanes work,anticipation,0.46133286,0.027027027027027,0.027027027027027,0.1621621621621621,0.027027027027027,0.0,0.5405405405405406,0.0,0.1891891891891892,0.0,0.0,0.027027027027027,0.094147582697201,0.0290885480074669,care,loyalty,0.5405405405405406,0.1621621621621621

he just has the wrong allies he committed the un-forgiven sin of being on the wrong side he hanged out with people who dont appreciate friendships or ideologies just pragmatic interests pahlavi fell just because he chose to be our ally not our enemy if he was our enemy he would have been the shah of iran till today i’m here not denying that he was corrupt and that he is responsible for the crimes made under his role i’m just saying that he could have been more corrupt and could have done more human rights violations and still remain in power if he had different allies why im thinking in that just because the pew research center has published its recent study saying that 29% of muslims in egypt find suicide bombing justified and knowing that nearly 10% of egyptians are christians we reach a conclusion that only 20% of egyptian voters consider the palestinian terrorism a resistance this will include islamists nationalists and the radical left but the crisis is that western countries dont see in egypt except these 20% these 20% are the ones receiving all of the international attention and support they are the ones receiving the usa aid and the eu funds they are the ones honored in international ceremonies and get the most famous prizes they are the ones who meet mr obama get honored by michelle obama and admired by the european parliament they are the ones who are considered credible resources for the international human rights organizations actually the weakness of egyptian liberals isnt more than a self-fulfilling prophecy after the revolution europe and usa thought that islamists are strong and liberals are week so they decided to buy islamists huge amount of funds and politic support started moving from usa and eu to islamists in egypt even israel used all its diplomacy trying to build contacts with islamists and ignored the other actors in the game islamists used this support to reach power in july 2012 mohammed hussein heikal an egyptian writer who has been close to the egyptian dictatorship all over his life described the american pressure on the army to deliver power to islamists as 1942 incident in which the british troops surrounded the egyptian kings palace to force him to change the government we egyptian liberals committed also the shahs greatest sin when we considered europe usa and israel as allies an ally is someone who actually supports you as much as you support him which never happened with our so-called allies now we are paying for this mistake in our exile and those we considered allies are paying also from their security posted by maikel nabil sanad at 2:28 pm labels: articles - en 11,joy,0.4918519,0.15625,0.125,0.15625,0.15625,0.0,0.0625,0.0,0.15625,0.0,0.09375,0.09375,0.065040650406504,0.0048719618055555,loyalty,care,0.15625,0.15625

26,64,The War Over Blasphemy,2015-07-31 00:00:00,Maikel Nabil,,-0.381433,US,the war over blasphemy >> 31 july 2015 #fullpost{display:inline;} photo: demonstration outside the saudi embassy in helsinki finland on behalf of raif badawi (courtesy of amnesty finland via flickr) two weeks ago iceland abolished its 75-year-old blasphemy law the parliament’s decision was a victory for the unconventional pirate party which made the call to abolish the blasphemy law in iceland after the charlie hebdo terrorist attacks in france churches in iceland publically opposed this step but this didn’t prevent the bill from gaining a vast majority in the icelandic parliament one month before on june 7 saudi arabia’s supreme courts decided to uphold the sentence of 1000 lashes and 10 years imprisonment on the saudi activist raif badawi raif the founder of the saudi liberal network was originally detained in june 2012 on charges of blasphemy and apostasy so far badawi has served three years of his sentence and already received 50 lashes last january his courageous wife ensaf haidar has initiated a huge campaign on his behalf raif was also nominated for the nobel peace prize because of his contribution to freedom in saudi arabia but it seems that all of that is not enough to get him released saudi arabia isn’t the only country that targets blasphemers and nonbelievers according to a report published by the pew research institute in 2012 one out of every five countries has anti-blasphemy laws or policies and one of every 10 countries penalizes apostasy both the icelandic and the saudi decisions show contrasting approaches to dealing with blasphemy these days countries like netherlands norway and iceland are getting rid of their old blasphemy laws other countries like ireland are introducing new blasphemy laws and countries like saudi arabia and egypt are increasing their persecution of blasphemers the saudi hell saudi arabia is the last place an atheist or a blasphemer would like to be in not only is atheism classified as an act of terrorism and apostasy and blasphemy are punishable by death but also because physical punishment is legal in saudi arabia a blasphemer can be tortured and lashed for years before he is handed to the executioner saudi arabia’s legal system is based on sharia law which is basically the instructions of the quran hadith and some other historic islamic sources but the main difference between saudi arabia and other islamic countries that apply sharia law is that saudi arabia doesn’t have written laws that define sharia but leaves it to policemen and judges to interpret and implement the historic islamic texts and since the prophet of islam mohamed had ordered “you shall kill whoever changes his religion saudi judges would consider blasphemy an act of apostasy and punish blasphemers by death last april the former saudi king abdullah issued a new decree criminalizing activities considered hostile to the kingdom and now defined as acts of terrorism the saudi interior ministry followed with a list of groups criminalized by this decree and atheists were among those groups the irony here is that terrorism is now punished in saudi arabia according to the new decree with 20 years imprisonment while apostasy and blasphemy are punishable by death but as atheists are considered terrorists as well they will be punished under both laws raif badawi isn’t the only one whom saudi arabia punished for blasphemy and apostasy the kingdom has a long list of victims and it’s hard to know most of the names in the list because of the country’s lack of transparency and efficient civil society the saudi blogger hamza kashgari was hunted down in malaysia deported to saudi arabia charged with blasphemy because of his anti-religious writings and kept in prison for 20 months until he recanted his apostasy the first act kashgary did after being released was publishing a picture of him together with an imam receiving a gift of a copy of the quran in 2005 hamza al-maziani and muhammad al-harbi were sentenced to imprisonment and a whipping for blasphemy al-maziani’s crime was writing an article about the quality of education in saudi arabia and al-harbi’s crime was talking to students about chemistry and judaism in 2007 the general court of jeddah sentenced turkish national sabri bogday to death for “swearing at allah” bogday remained in prison until 2009 when king abdulla pardoned and deported him back to turkey sabri’s release came according to a saudi diplomat after he repented and asked god for forgiveness but such harsh saudi stance on atheism and blasphemy should be seen as a reaction not as an action the saudi authorities have been overwhelmed lately with the growing numbers of atheists in the kingdom the saudi royal family uses religion an essential tool to remain in power and growing disbelief threatens their legitimacy it has been reported that atheists represent now 5-9% of the saudi population in 2010 7% of saudis did not consider religion important in their lives in 2014 only saudi authorities has blocked over than 24000 websites mostly atheist and pornographic ones the authorities arrested 76 people because of some of these websites last january saudi atheists secretly held the first atheist forum in mecca around a 100 atheists took part in this event it was a shock to the saudi regime as mecca is the holiest city for muslims and non-muslims aren’t allowed to enter the city the fact that organized apostates who left islam could meet in mecca was enough to drive the saudi king to issue his decree three months afterward sudan: run by a war criminal sudan has many things in common with saudi arabia both criminalize apostasy and blasphemy and both approve physical punishment including lashing sudan as well doesn’t have a properly developed civil society or free media which makes it easy for the sudanese government to target individuals without international attention section 125 of the sudanese criminal law criminalizes blasphemy with punishments of imprisonment fines and up to 40 lashes of a whip apostasy criminalized by article 126 of the same law is punishable by death the most famous blasphemy case involved gillian gibbons and became known in media as the “sudanese teddy bear blasphemy case” gibbons a school teacher was sentenced in 2007 to imprisonment and deportation after she was found guilty of blasphemy her crime was that she used a teddy bear named “muhammed” in her classroom which the court considered blasphemous khartoum sudan’s capital erupted in riots as religious extremists demanded her death gibbons’s british citizenship helped ensure that she returned safely to her country mohammed taha wasn’t as lucky as gibbons taha the editor of the sudanese newspaper al-wifaq was an islamist and a member of the national islamic front taha’s newspaper ran an article in late 2005 questioning the ancestry of the prophet of islam the sudanese authorities detained tried and convicted him for blasphemy and fined his newspaper eight million sudanese pounds islamic radicals set fire to his newspapers and kidnapped him he was later found beheaded egypt: theocratic military junta egypt’s legal system is a total mess on one side article 2 of the 2014’s constitution makes sharia law the main source of all legislation but on the other side article 64 of the same constitution guarantees the freedom of belief article 64 also restricts the freedom of practicing religious rituals to “heavenly religions” a term used in islam to refer to the three religions: judaism christianity and islam article 7 of the constitution gives special status to the al-azhar mosque in cairo making it a kind of a state church many bills and court decisions are sent to al-azhar for approval before being issued egypt’s penal code which goes back to 1937 criminalizes blasphemy in article 98 according to this article only blasphemy against the three “heavenly religions” is punishable in practice most of blasphemy cases in egypt are made against atheists and christians some against shiite muslims and very few against sunni muslims al-azhar a conservative institution has used every possible opportunity to put atheists and blasphemers behind bars in 2006 al-azhar started a blasphemy case against the atheist blogger kareem amer he was sentenced to four years in prison and became the first-ever egyptian blogger to be imprisoned because of his writings the authorities tortured amer several times during his imprisonment because he left islam after the 2011 uprising the egyptian state started using every possible oppressive tool including the anti-blasphemy article in the penal code to silence the youth struggling for democracy the number of blasphemy cases and convictions in egypt in the last four years exceeds the entire number of such cases from the previous 30 years the list of people charged with blasphemy after the revolution included the famous businessman naguib sawiris google charlie hebdo magazine and the former french president nicolas sarkozy i too was charged officially with blasphemy in october 2012 over

they requested that the defense ministry allow them to serve in civilian positions instead but the egyptian army ignored their cases leaving them in illegal status unable to work study or travel the same circumstances are now occurring with my brother mark nabil after the military stopped his conscription procedures last april on security grounds but refuses to give him his conscription document disallowing him from working studying or traveling mark graduated from university over a year ago but because the egyptian military refuses to grant him his official documents he has been unemployed and unable to travel legally during the last year and will probably be trapped in this endless loop for months or years sadly this isnt the only damage to egypts economy caused by its army the egyptian military is deeply entrenched in the nation’s business sector owning about 87% of egypts land and over one third of its businesses such intervention in the market drives competition away and decreases the number of jobs military-owned corporations dont create jobs because they use recruits as free labor and the recruitment of youths for years at the start of their careers creates obstacles in the paths of young people who want to become entrepreneurs conscription also deprives the egyptian government of tax money which those young egyptians would pay if they weren’t forced into military service and could instead work in a private industry many international actors including the us government support the egyptian military in the belief that egypts army can restore stability and in doing so stem the flow of refugees out of egypt but its the egyptian military through its stubbornness dealing with the conscientious objection issue which generates refugees every day the world sends billions of dollars in aid to the egyptian military regime aiming in an attempt to stimulate the economy and reduce unemployment but its the egyptian army with its hardline stance on conscription which denies many egyptians the legal right to work in egypt the egyptian military regime must be pressured to ease up on its conscription law allowing a legal status for those who dont want to serve in the army instead of forcing them to be unemployed or flee the country this article was published in english in the huffington post and in german in connection ev posted by maikel nabil sanad at 4:09 pm labels: articles -

31,69,What Egypt Needs to Do,2013-09-14 00:00:00,Maikel Nabil,,-0.326269,US,what egypt needs to do >> 14 september 2013 #fullpost{display:inline;} a prescription for egypt over two months have passed since the july 3 coup in egypt but nearly nothing new has been achieved assurances of reform by the new leadership differ little from the ones given by previous dictators including mubarak tantawi and morsi the current legal framework is now essentially back to what it was during mubaraks rule the leaders of the new military government declared a state of emergency when they took over and on sept 12 they extended it unconstitutionally for another two months the new leadership is distracting us with its games: curfews a few superficial amendments to the egyptian constitution that leave its authoritarian core untouched and an imaginary war on terror against groups that the government refuses to consider terrorists (the egyptian army claims that it is now fighting units of hamas but insist that it’ a resistance group rather than a terrorist organization) the new egyptian administration should stop playing games and trying to buy time the oppressive laws of the dictatorship must be dropped immediately a society cant undergo a transition if basic freedoms are restricted -- unless that is the transition is meant to be toward dictatorship first the egyptian government must address the issue of freedom of expression the authoritarian penal code criminalizes opinions specifying some 20 specific views that can land egyptian citizens in prison merely for expressing them section 14 of the penal code refers to journalism crimes criminalizing such opinions as: encouraging recruits to disobey orders; erotic literature; affecting the reputation of the country; insulting the president; insulting a foreign president; insulting a foreign diplomat; insulting the army the parliament or the courts; and insulting a civil servant and thats not even to mention section 11 which criminalizes blasphemy thousands of egyptians have been jailed or fined because of these articles since 1937 when the code was first issued i was one of them having been sentenced to three years in prison after i criticized the army in 2011 im free now but tens of others remain in prison for speaking out we cant call a country democratic if its citizens are not allowed to criticize their government how are candidates supposed to campaign in elections if they know that they can land in prison for the opinions they express while campaigning a democracy is not a democracy without freedom of expression and egypt has to remove these oppressive laws if it wants to move forward second egyptian civil society should be allowed to function the current civil society law was issued in 2002 and it restricts the activity of non-government organizations threatening civil society activists with jail time simply for doing their work all of us still remember how a court sentenced 43 ngo workers to prison on charges of receiving foreign funding the same verdict also ordered the confiscation of documents from a group of nonprofit organizations including the konrad adenauer foundation freedom house the international republican institute and the national democratic institute egypt needs a civil society law that should guarantee four conditions: citizens should have the freedom to form their own organizations the government should remove restrictions on the political activity of ngos the state should be barred from interfering in the internal decisions of civil society groups finally such groups should have full freedom to raise their own funding if these conditions are met then the countrys citizens will finally be in a position to build a strong civil society a crucial precondition for the further democratization of the country so far however the government has said nothing about reforming the current repressive law third the government must allow outside observers to monitor elections egypt has not had a genuinely free election since a group of military officers abolished the democracy in 1952 it stretches credulity to claim as his own government did that gamal abdel nasser was truly elected with 999 percent of the vote in 1956 egyptians protested in 2011 against the parliamentary election held the previous year which they believed had been rigged the military then dissolved the parliament and arranged another election in 2011 that was so plagued by obvious fraud that egyptian courts declared it illegal there are cases now in front of the administrative court arguing that the 51 million names in the voter database contain around 13 million repeated and fake names (some 25 percent of the total) we can be sure that future politicians chosen in elections will also be accused of fraud if this issue is not addressed properly after the july 3 coup the new rulers have stated several times that they are prepared to accept international election monitors but theres a catch according to the transitional roadmap issued by the new government the election is scheduled to take place three months from now though most election monitoring missions need to spend at least six months in a country in order to set up operations since the egyptian government has yet to issue any formal invitations to international observers it should be clear that the military rulers have no desire to allow a clean election and that in turn makes it almost inevitable that the next government in egypt will face challenges to its legitimacy (especially by the islamists) and that will lead to more instability in egypt fourth egypt should abide by the international legal framework on human rights and elections over the past few decades the egyptian dictatorship has been notably reluctant to sign any international documents that would ensure greater freedom to egyptian citizens international organizations have very limited authority to monitor human rights violations in egypt since the country has never signed or ratified most of the corresponding treaties foreign minister nabil el-araby pledged in 2011 that egypt would sign the additional protocols to the international covenant on civil and political rights but this never happened if the new administration in egypt wants to prove that a democratization process is under way then it should sign and ratify both the additional protocols to the international covenant on civil and political rights and the rome statute governing the international criminal court egypt should also join the council of europe and the commonwealth of nations it defies common sense to claim that egypt is a democracy while the countrys international participation is restricted to dictators clubs such as the arab league and the organization of islamic cooperation egypt has now endured three years of profound instability the economy is shrinking thousands have lost their lives in political violence embassies had been attacked egyptian territory has been used as a base for attacks on other states if egypt does not begin to face its real problems now the chaos will grow neither egypt nor the

32,70,Are We Becoming Cowards?,2013-08-26 00:00:00,Maikel Nabil,,-0.330068,US,are we becoming cowards >> 26 august 2013 #fullpost{display:inline;} last june tony blair in his article commenting on islamic extremism referred to islamic radicals “those with that view think we are weak and that gives them strength” blair didn’t agree of course with such argument describing “pluralistic liberal open minded societies” to be weak i’ve lived most of my life in egypt surrounded by nationalists and islamists who were repeating every day that westerners and israelis are weak and cowards they used to say that they “islamists” love death as much as westerners love life at that time as i was seeing nationalists and islamists being defeated in every battle i didn’t take their arguments seriously i considered it part of “denial syndrome” but as i grew older i learned that the issue is not that simple few months ago while studying china i was surprised to know that the chinese army was defeated when they invaded vietnam in 1979 i asked a vietnamese friend a daughter of a vietnamese veteran “what’s your secret weapon how you defeated both the americans and the chinese” she said that they are being taught from their childhood that it’s fine to die for their country that’s why they don’t care about anything when they struggle for their country what blair didn’t get is that those suicidal fighters in afghanistan egypt or vietnam who are unemployed uneducated under-nutritioned and maybe deprived from sex don’t have anything to lose their lives don’t worth anything in their eyes on the other side european or american soldiers chose to be in the military not to die but to have a career to help themselves to enjoy their lives better a jihadist dreams to die and becomes a martyr to be able to eat meat daily and to have sex with 72 virgins while a european soldier dreams of a raise in his salary simply that’s why usa will never win in afghanistan as long the majority of afghanis are suffering from poverty and illiteracy they will continue fighting it doesn’t matter if they fight the russians the americans or even each other’s at the end the need to kill themselves fighting to escape from their horrible lives the only way to convince them to stop fighting is to spoil them with our good education and a good life obama’s last statement on egypt is a nice illustration to this dilemma as the egyptian military for the last three years has made every possible offense they killed and injured thousands of civilians they may have used chemical weapons against civilians in nov 2011 they attacked american foundations (ndi iri and freedom house) confiscated their computers and documents and held american ngo workers in house arrest (including ray lahood the son of the us minister of transportation) for a long time they lunched an anti-american propaganda which lasts until today and facilitated the attack of the israeli and the american embassies and after all that the only reaction obama made was cancelling the biannual joint military training exercise between usa and egypt which means that the 13 billion dollar military aid paid from american tax-payers money will continue to go normally to egypt’s army in my last visit to the usa congress in 2012 i was told that scaf members who visited washington dc few months before made it clear that they will drop egypt’s peace treaty with israel if the usa military aid was canceled at that time i couldn’t understand why usa accepts to be blackmailed by a bunch of third world generals and if the egyptian army treats usa like this how would they treat usa if they have oil or nuclear abilities like pakistan or iran some say that if the military aid was canceled the first ones who will face damage are the american security companies who are benefiting from the aid creating damaging effects on employment rates and tax revenues in the aiding country of course the egyptian generals know that and uses this in each chance last tuesday usa principal deputy press secretary josh earnest expressed this difficulty saying “providing foreign assistance is not like a spigot you dont turn it off and on or turn it up or down like a faucet” isn’t it strange that the superpower in our planet can’t take a decision about aids it’s giving and has to continue unwillingly to arm a bloody dictatorship like egypt if so who is the weak side here compare obama’s behavior to george w bush crusades in afghanistan and iraq which makes the one wonder if syrians would have avoided their recent suffering if bush was in the white house today in response to the last massacres in egypt the council of the european union decided to stop exporting any weapons to egypt egyptians didn’t take such decision seriously first because europe didn’t stop military cooperation with egypt which includes running projects of training egyptian military officers second because they know that egypt still can import european weapons easily through saudi arabia or israel third and that’s the important point because egyptians know that europeans don’t have the guts to stop exporting weapons to saudi arabia simply europe can’t claim to be moral by stopping weapons exportation to egypt’s army “the small demon” while continuing weapons exportation to the saudi army “the big demon” in most of my speeches and media interviews in europe and israel people usually ask me the same questions “weren’t you afraid to stand against your government are you afraid to go back to egypt are you afraid from being imprisoned again” in fact such questions doesn’t make sense to me i was detained five times in egypt exposed to torture and could be assassinated in any country if i crossed the red line i may never recover from the traumas i got in egypt prison and death lost their abilities to affect my decisions i was smiling after i was sentenced to 3 years in 2011 telling other prisoners that i’m lucky not being killed but after a year living in europe i started to feel that i’m changing i’ve lived all my life in egypt an outlawed and never cared about that now in germany i’ve become more interested in following laws and respecting them i started facing hard questions which i never had to face before like how to eat healthy food or how to enjoy a weekend life in democracies are spoiling me i’m not a holy worrier anymore francis fukuyama in his book “the end of history” said that democracies grow to become “a paper tiger” scary like a tiger but weak like a paper the west may have nuclear weapons but they are not useful if your enemy knows that you can’t use them the nice life we have in the first world which made us vegetarians and pacifists wouldn’t help at all when we face barbarians as blood and animalian power is

33,71,They Burned My Church,2013-08-15 00:00:00,Maikel Nabil,,-0.287234,US,they burned my church >> 15 august 2013 #fullpost{display:inline;} they burned the churches and with them my childhood yesterday a few minutes after the egyptian police attacked the muslim brotherhood sit-ins in cairo islamists started targeting christians (copts) and churches all over the country over 25 churches were burned down and lots of shops and private properties of christians were robbed and destroyed among the burned ones was the adventist chapel in asyut the place where i attended my kindergarten for around two years i remember how i didn’t like it because one of the servants there used to hit me i remember also how i used to smell the lemon trees in the chapel yard after burning the adventist chapel islamists in asyut burned down st george church also nuns had to flee the church to surrounding buildings while islamists took furniture from the church and burned it in the street i used to pray in this church for six years and had my sunday school there for more than 14 years i had lots of good and bad memories related to this place which once i considered my home i don’t consider myself a christian any more since i became an atheist in 2007 i faced lots of harassment from egypt’s christians as the coptic orthodox church has medieval beliefs similar to how catholics were in the middle ages they went crazy because of my convert to atheism priests visited me in my house and threated me not to spread my atheist ideas rumors were spread against me by church servants some christians even tried to put me in jail for blasphemy while others were inciting the army to put me in jail again but for me as i follow what’s happening to christians in egypt right now i’m forced to remember what happened to the egyptian jews 70 years ago when the muslim brothers did the same thing by bombing synagogues and burning jewish properties at that time egypt had around 80 thousand jewish citizens after the coup of 1952 nasser joined the muslim brothers in the campaign against jews nazi criminals were given refuge in egypt while egyptian jews were driven to concentration camps the egyptian army later deported most of the egyptian jews and removed their citizenship after robbing their properties now there are less than 100 jews in egypt after that other religious memories were targeted also shiite islam and baha’ism were banned by law with their properties given to al-azhar christians were targeted by both islamists and the army the same army which usa funds while this army forces recruits to yell every day “no god except allah mohammed in the prophet of allah jews are enemies of allah” the same army which massacred the christian protest in maspero in oct 2011 leaving over twenty christians killed and before that in february 2011 attacked monks in st bishoy monastry with rpjs while soldiers were enjoying breaking crosses violent attacks happens against christians every day by islamists while the state makes sure each time that the predators are not prosecuted in the same time ayman youssef mansour gamal abdu massoud and other christians are in prisons now for blasphemy because they expressed their christian beliefs on facebook my fear is that egypt’s christians are going to face the same destiny as its jews as of now over 4 million egyptian christian have left the country already leaving behind around 8 million more (the third has left) now as egypt may face a civil war after the july 3rd coup massacres against christians would happen more rousing more fears of a new holocaust i’m not sure what could be the solution for this problem the egyptian army is quite racist and won’t protect christians western countries and israel have lots of security interests with the egyptian army and wouldn’t risk it even for 8 million christians if ben-gurion didn’t do anything for egypt’s jews who would do anything for its christians the issue even becomes more complicated with europe trying to be nice to islamists to contain terrorism in europe in the past jews tried to escape germany and run away from the nazi rule but nearly no country accepted them usa turned back ships of jewish refugees sending them back to death in germany while uk prevented them from immigrating to palestine england was quite nice to accept only jewish kids under the (the kindertransport) to make sure they didn’t have their bar mitzvah and thus not jewish yet i believe egypt’s christians (and also syrian christians) could be facing the same destiny they are a minority who have been prosecuted it this country with racist state institutions that planned for decades to extradite them while the world is unable to take any measures to ensure their safety for a long time i believed that christians (and other religious minorities) shouldn’t leave egypt i was saying that they should stay and struggle for their rights i myself untill now refused to apply for asylum or to have another passport to make sure that i’m going back to egypt after i finish my master study in germany but some coptic activists believe that western countries should open their borders to egypt’s christians before a genocide happens they may be right i won’t like to risk other people’s lives for my ideology in the end i believe that people should have to right to choose for themselves but will the free world take responsibility at this moment and offer a refuge for these minorities or will we just keep watching pretending that nothing happening until it’s too late  building memorials and recognizing genocides won’t bring people back to life this article was published in english in the huffington post and in dutch in the volkskrant posted by maikel nabil

35,73,The Myth of Religious Freedom in Muslim Countries,2013-05-07 00:00:00,Maikel Nabil,,-0.437162,US,the myth of religious freedom in muslim countries >> 07 may 2013 #fullpost{display:inline;} if you are an atheist then you are lucky that you aren’t in bangladesh this week last sunday violence blew up in the bangladesh capital dhaka leaving at least 30 dead people behind the violence was organized by a collation of islamic groups call themselves “hefazat-e islam” which means in arabic “protectors of islam” islamists took the streets chanting “hang atheists” aiming to abolish the secular regime and start hunting atheists this wasn’t the first time that this violence happens in bangladesh last september a muslim mob destroyed twelve pagodas and more than fifty buddhists houses in ramu in bangladesh because of a facebook photo derogating the koran your god is illegal actually the problem is rooted in the legal framework which delegalize religious groups indonesia as an example has around 86% muslim population constitutionally the country acknowledges six different religions: islam christianity (only protestantism and catholicism) buddhism hinduism and confucianism ahmadiyya and other religious groups are not permitted to practice christians need special permission to build churches last october in the country’s island of sumatra a special aceh district provincial government shut down nine churches and 6 buddhist temples in aceh’s capital banda aceh egypt has a similar story with authorities which don’t recognize any religions besides sunni-islam and christianity they claim that they also recognize judaism but it’s hard to believe that in a country expelled its 80 thousands jews in the 1950s and just shut down its last active synagogue this past september many of bahais shiite mormons buddhists hindus jehovah’s witnesses and others are not allowed to practice their religions in egypt and if they did they would be arrested immediately christians are not permitted to build churches without the express permission of the president something they rarely get registration of religious groups exists in europe usa and other free countries but in these free countries registration is just a bureaucratic process which usually doesn’t consume time and made mainly for tax-exemption but obviously countries like egypt and saudi arabia are using the registration process as a way to prevent people from their human right to practice their beliefs saudi arabia has gone a bit more far than egypt beside requiring being a muslim for the saudi citizenship and limiting access to some cities only to muslims saudi arabia forbids practicing any other religion on its land except islam no one is allowed to build a church synagogue or any other places of worship in saudi arabia except mosques christian foreign workers usually got arrested by the saudi police if they gathered in any house to pray together in azerbaijan 4 baptist christians were arrested in november for gathering together in prayer without permission at a private house the police raided the place cut the electricity and arrested the owner of the place and 3 others the four arrested were tried that same night and imprisoned local churches in the region complained that their applications for recognition from the state have been blocked by bureaucracy jailed because of their belief pakistan decided to hit a record with blasphemy cases the german newspaper der spiegel says that in the last two decades there have been more than 1200 people accused of blasphemy and that there is more than 100 cases still pending spiegel also mentioned that nearly 50 of these people were murdered after they were released last august a christian girl was arrested after she was accused of burning some papers of the koran and she is still being detained the most recent arrest of a school teacher arifa ahmed and asim farooqi the headmaster of the farooqi girls school in lahore were the cause of an angry mob protesting an english test which contained some words considered to be insulting to the prophet mohammed blasphemy cases exist in most of muslim countries in iran farshid fathi malayeri is serving a 6 year sentence since 2010 for converting from islam to christianity in saudi arabia the writer turki alhamad the blogger hamza kashgari and the founder of the saudi liberal forum raif badawy are jailed and being tried now for blasphemy which may result in the death penalty in kuwait abdel aziz mohamed albaz was sentenced to a year in prison with forced labor for his blog benbaz in indonesia alexander aan’s facebook comment ‘god doesn’t exist’ resulted in a two and a half year jail-term this past june in morocco the new islamic government arrested the atheist activist mohammed socrates accusing him of dealing drugs and sentenced him to 2 years imprisonment after he confessed under torture in tunisia courts have sentenced two activists jabeur mejri and ghazi beji to seven and a half years in prison for blasphemy also in egypt ayman youseef mansour gamal abdou masoud and mohammed asfour are serving a three year sentence for blasphemy while makarem diab said and bishoy el-beheri are serving six years for the same alleged crime it’s sad that some european countries like germany ireland and denmark still have blasphemy laws we understand that these european laws haven’t been used for decades but at the same time these laws are used as an excuse by authoritarian governments to take the freedoms of its citizens lots of work still needed on our planet cleaning dirty laws of free countries and pressuring un-free countries to recognize freedom of belief islamic human sacrifices indonesia also is facing this phenomenon of islamic violence eid al-adha or feast of sacrifice turned bloody last year as the islamist defenders front (fpi) attacked ahmadeyya congregations preventing them from celebrating their feast while in february 2012 merciless tortures and killings of ahmadiyya at the hand of islamists took place in cikeusik while they were shouting allah akbar “god is great” the perpetrators were only sentenced 3-6 months and the court blamed the ahmadiyya for inciting the attack in april 2012 an attack occurred in a shiite community in which two people were killed in sampang indonesia at least 270 refugees were left after the attack in sampang sunni muslims attacked shiite houses last october leaving nearly 200 shiite without a home displacing them unless they’re willing to convert to sunni islam in malaysia also you can see the same phenomenon christians complains that some former muslims who converted to christianity have been tortured and forced to return to islam a doctor was arrested for seeking childcare from a church and could face a three year sentence a tuition center was shut down by the education ministry this past august following claims that the teachers were trying to convert several malay muslim children studying there a church was raided after a complaint was received that it had attempted to convert the twelve muslims that attended the dinner back to africa where nigeria’s islamic extremists “boko haram” which means in the hausa language “education is sinful” celebrated christmas in 2011 by bomb blasts and shootings at churches in madalla jos gadaka and damaturu leaving 41 people dead boko haram is known for targeting churches universities police stations and even the moderate muslim cleric liman bana the organization is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of people and remains active using terrorism against non-muslims and muslims pushing nigeria back into the medieval ages in egypt the army used the chance of the revolution to invade st bishop monastery in feb 2011 and shot monks with rpjs the same army attacked the nonviolent christian demonstration in maspero in october 2011 and left behind at least 28 people dead and over 200 injured to this day not a single person was prosecuted for the massacre of christians in el-kosheh in 2000 in which 21 christians were killed islamic extremist groups are known to burn churches every couple of months and are protected by the state not forgetting the habit of bombing churches at christian feasts like what happened in alexandria 2011 and nagahamadi 2010 in march 2011 a salafi group burned a christian house in qena and cut an ear of its owner because the attitude of a girl living at that house was considered inappropriate few months later a court announced the predators “innocent” final words the crimes of islamic extremist groups are widespread in muslim countries: harakat al-shabaab al-mujahideen (hsm) in somalia the taliban in pakistan and afghanistan hezbollah in lebanon hamas in gaza the revolutionary guards in iran and the salafis in egypt and tunisia not to mention the islamic government in sudan which wanted to apply shariaa laws over the christian south leading to two civil wars resulting in hundreds of thousands of killings and millions of refugees the south is happily separated now but islamic militias are still killing and raping sudanese women in darfur while the government is blessing the predators the international criminal court hasn’t arrested yet the sudanese president hasan elbashir for his war crimes both of us live now in europe where being a believer or not is completely a personal freedom but we understand that people in other parts of the world don’t enjoy the same freedoms that’s why we are calling on the free world to pressure these countries

36,74,Egypt and Israel; let your Conscientious Objectors free,2013-04-11 00:00:00,Maikel Nabil,,-0.30181,US,egypt and israel; let your conscientious objectors free >> 11 april 2013 #fullpost{display:inline;} egyptians and israelis find something to agree on maybe it was the first time in egyptian history that a group of egyptian citizens protest in cairo for the freedom of a jewish israeli citizen in the same moment in which they recognize the right of israel to exist and promote peace with it last tuesday peace activists of “no to compulsory military service movements” protested in talaat harb square in cairo just a few meters from tahrir square the egyptian conscientious objectors emad dafrawi and mohammed fathi carried posters calling for the freedom of the israeli conscientious objector natan blanc natan for those who don’t know him is a 19 years old israeli citizen imprisoned now in israel for refusing to serve in the israeli army natan has been military-tried 8 times until now and served over 120 days in detention and will most likely have his ninth military trial this week on april 15 natan said in his objection declaration that he has reached his decision upon cast lead operation in 2008 when he noticed how this war fueled negative feelings in both sides and induced a wave of militarism in the israeli society in a video statement he made a few weeks ago natan spoke against the israeli occupation to west bank and said that it’s not democratic to prevent palestinians from voting in israeli elections as long as they are living under the israeli state every israeli citizen is obligated to serve in the idf when they reach 18-years of age (three years for males two years for females) israel maybe the only country in mema region which its laws recognize the right to refuse the military service for reasons related to belief and conscience but on practice the israeli army has been very strict in their interpretation of who qualifies as a conscientious objector and sends most people that refuse military service to prison for disobeying military orders in order to circumvent the army israeli youth have managed to find some loopholes by claiming to have psychological troubles (according to new profile activists nearly 4% of israeli youth get exempted from the military service each year by this way) the interesting thing about natan is that while he could have copied the practices of other abstainers he refused in order to emphasize his opposition to the practices of the idf in egypt it may be a bit worse egyptian laws don’t recognize the right of egyptians to refuse military service on basis of belief or conscientious in 2010 i was the first egyptian to refuse the military service for contradiction with my morals and principles the military ignored me for nearly a year and then in nov 2010 i was kidnapped by the military police from my house i was released next day after being exempted from the military service on the grounds that i was suffering from acute personality disorder according to them (a disease that hasnt yet been discovered by psychologists) after the military took power in feb 2011 one of the first things the military did was arresting me again accusing me of spreading false information that affected the reputation of the army military trying me and sentencing me to 3 years in prison luckily the international society reacted and i was released after 10 months and 130 days of hunger strike in 2012 two other egyptian activists announced their refusal to serve in the army for contradiction with their conscious the first was emad darawi the editor of ‘children of peace’ an amateur linguistic and a graduate journalism collage he is also a famous peace activist who promoted good relations with israel for a long time emad told the jerusalem post last january that the egyptian dictatorship is responsible for the anti-israel incitement and that most of egyptians don’t have a problem with israel the second is mohammed fathi the editor of “all colors” who was very offended by the violence of the army against civilians after the revolution as a vegetarian peaceful person he decided that his conscious can’t accept obeying military orders of such army both emad and mohammed continue to live in limbo since the day they refused to report to the military recruitment center without documentation from the army saying that they have finished their military service they are barred from taking part in fundamental aspects of society they are not allowed to work and hiring them is punishable by 2 years imprisonment they are not allowed to travel or even to have passports they are not allowed to study at any egyptian university and of course the military can arrest them at any moment military-try them and send them to jail for long years the egyptian authorities even the constitution guarantees the freedom of belief have been ignoring all their requests to serve in an alternative civilian service all the egyptian human rights organizations abandoned them because of their peace activism and until now there not a single human rights lawyer accepted to represent them legally even international human rights groups like amnesty international human rights watch and the united nations human rights council have never mentioned their cases last week i contacted the israeli foreign ministry considering natan’s case surprisingly they reacted in the same way as the egyptian authorities they just ignored my message in a manner indicative of the israeli and the egyptian governments disregard for human rights criticism choosing instead to go forward with their policies that make their citizens suffer the problem in middle east is not that we lack peace activists the problem is that our governments keep peace activists busy fighting for their basic rights instead of letting them free to build peace this article was published in the

i’m trying to put it in its real size if we wanted palestinians and egyptians to not believe that israelis are “blood-sucking vampires” and if we wanted israelis not to believe that “all arabs are terrorists” both sides have to at least encounter each other in a regular daily manner meetings between citizens of both sides have to stop being a challenge done only by crazy or courageous people the only way to fight conspiracy theories is for people to know each other on a personal level and governments are responsible for creating the environment in which such meetings are possible eastern germans weren’t liberated until they stopped seeing the berlin wall as security and started seeing it as captivity; and the same was true of russians with the iron curtain israelis have to see that their government has transformed israel into a big prison surrounded by walls from every side israelis have to break down their walls i can’t promise them that they will find only good people on the other side they will find only human beings just like them this article was published in the times of israel posted by maikel nabil sanad at 10:11 pm labels: articles - en 4,disgust,0.7111896,0.2666666666666666,0.0,0.0666666666666666,0.2,0.0,0.2,0.0,0.1333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.1333333333333333,0.0374064837905236,0.0109135802469135,care,care,0.2,0.2666666666666666

going to visit israel and palestine for the first time in my life finally after a long time of being denied travel by egyptian authorities and after being pushed away by the israeli embassy in cairo i am scheduled to give my first speech on december 23 at the truman institute of the hebrew university in jerusalem the same university which ahmed lutfi el-sayed my godfather represented egypt at its opening ceremony nine decades ago later during my stay i’ll also speak for the world union of jewish students in 31 december 2012 and also for tel aviv university in 2 january 2013 i’ll also visit ramallah (palestine) to meet palestinian activists people around the world will be able to follow my trip through twitter hash tag #maikelinisrael after years of calling for peace i have realized that practicing peace is more important than talking my visit is a message from the egyptian peace community that we have had enough violence and confrontation and we want this to end we want to live together as human beings without violence racism or walls i’m aiming with my visit to end the monopoly which governments have over peace processes our governments held this portfolio for decades and obviously they have gone from one failure to the next it’s time to open the process to other actors if we couldn’t achieve anything at least the competition will pressure politicians to work harder my trip is organized by un watch the human rights organization based in geneva which played a role in defending my freedom when i was imprisoned in egypt last year for 10 months for defending human rights its director hillel neuer is known for his scathing attacks on dictatorships in the un human rights council he is a very brave person and a good friend while applying for the visa i opposed the idea of getting a visa to israel without putting a stamp in my passport to avoid being banned from entering countries which don’t allow those who visited israel before to enter i decided this simply because i don’t wish to visit any country which doesn’t recognize the right of any other country to exist having two passports or having a visa without a stamp is just encouraging racist regimes to continue practicing racism in the 21st century racist regimes should pay for their racism not be encouraged by tourism in the end i received my visa on a separate paper i’m sad that the state of israel is adapting to this ugly situation from the beginning i decided also that i’m not going to visit any religious places and i won’t meet any members of the clergy religions have been always part of the problem not part of the solution fighting wars racism and violence obligates me to avoid their causes and religions are on the top of them middle-easterners will be following my visit with their eyes if i succeeded more will follow it can be a point of change in history anyone who cares about peace is invited to do whatever he can do to make this visit succeed in improving the situation in the mideast in the end i understand that i may face a horrible fate because of my visit while walking in jerusalem i won’t be able to stop my mind from thinking about king abdullah anwar al-sadat and yitzhak rabin but still i’m willing to take this step to put another brick in the wall willing that others will follow doing the same thing believing that one day we will be able to end this

40,78,"Yes, I’m a blasphemer. Get over it.",2012-10-19 00:00:00,Maikel Nabil,,-0.49707,US,yes i’m a blasphemer get over it >> 19 october 2012 #fullpost{display:inline;} on october 7 2012 the office of the egyptian general prosecutor decided to start an official investigation accusing me of blasphemy -- or as they call it insulting islam my crime was expressing my atheist beliefs on my twitter account the egyptian authorities also arrested my friend alber saber on similar charges he remains in jail to this day egypt has signed many international treaties that ensure freedom of expression but the egyptian penal code still has approximately 20 laws that make certain opinions a crime the specified offenses include criticizing the president the parliament the military or the judiciary criticizing a foreign president such as mahmoud ahmadinejad or bashar al-assad is also a crime punishable with a three-year term in prison when i learned of the charges against me and saber i remembered my friend kareem amer a famous egyptian blogger who was sentenced to four years in prison in 2007 for insulting both islam and then-president mubarak kareem suffered a great deal in prison he was tortured several times and spent a long time in solitary confinement under horrible conditions the latest threat of legal action against me has also stirred up memories of my previous imprisonment last year when i was imprisoned in egypt for 10 months for the crime of insulting the institution of the military since then two corrupt police officers sayyed abdel-kareem and mohammed abdel-rahman have declared that they want to file an additional case against me theyre both accusing me of insulting islam during my imprisonment in el-marg prison theyve tried to use this new case as a form of blackmail to keep me from speaking about the torture i faced while i was there (their accusation is entirely separate from the case brought against me by the prosecutor by the way) alber is not the only opinion prisoner in egypt accused of criticizing islam there are at least six christians (three of them under the age of 18) four atheists and one shiite who now face the same charges and it is no surprise that not one of them is a sunni muslim its a new inquisition happening in egypt in the twenty-first century while the whole world remains silent it started last year when ayman youseef mansour a 22-year-old christian blogger was sentenced on october 22 2011 to three years in prison because he criticized islam on his facebook page egyptian courts later refused his appeal denying him his right to reconsider the severity of the sentence aymans case was followed in january 2012 by the case of gamal abdou masoud 17 a christian from asyut in upper egypt gamal was tagged on facebook in a picture that criticized islam angry mobs surrounded his house because of this picture burned his house and the houses of other christians in the village and forced his family to leave the police didnt arrest anyone from the mobs instead gamal was sentenced to three years in prison for insulting islam then in april 2012 another christian was imprisoned on the same charges makarem diab said a teacher (also from asyut) was sentenced to six years simply for using some aggressive words against islam when he was quarrelling with one of his colleagues at work last month on september 12 a court in sohag sentenced another christian bishoy el-beheri to six years in prison for criticizing islam and criticizing president mohammed morsi this case is very similar to kareems the only difference is that in kareems case he got only one year in jail for criticizing mubarak while criticizing the present president leads to three years earlier this month the al-ahram newspaper reported that two coptic christian children nabil nagy rizk 10 and mina nady farag 9 were arrested for insulting islam because they were caught playing with papers that happened to have some verses of the quran written on them the kids were released later but the case against them hasnt been dropped yet meaning that they can be jailed also for three years on october 6 a female student known only by her initials of br went to the police station in sharkia asking for help complaining that her mother tried to poison her but the authorities decided that the student and her boyfriend should be jailed because they are atheists who believe that premarital sex is not a sin it is not only atheists and christians who are being jailed in egypt for blasphemy a shiite man mohammed asfour was sentenced to three years in prison last july for speaking against the crimes made by followers of mohammed the prophet of islam many others are in prison on the same charges and more will surely follow the general prosecutor has just sent a case against google officials to the state security investigations department in egypt accusing the internet company of failing to block the movie innocence of muslims from its search engine the prosecutor has also started an investigation against the poet hisham al-gokh whom he accused of insulting religion in his poetry these activists suffer because egypt doesnt have an independent judiciary many cases take decades to go before egyptian courts but when the issue is political they can finish the case in a few days just as they finished my trial 12 days after my arrest in march 2011 they are now doing the same with alber obviously there is a political reason for the egyptian regime to jail him they wish to intimidate christians and other minorities to force them to leave the country that is why albers trial is being processed so fast in comparison with other cases in egypt if there was a proper international response perhaps they would proceed with more caution alber expects to be sentenced to three years imprisonment within a short time meanwhile though there is a campaign supporting his freedom on facebook and twitter which is gaining momentum every day the worst part is that this phenomenon of jailing bloggers on charges of insulting religion is now becoming widespread in muslim countries in saudi arabia young blogger hamza kashgari is now in jail on blasphemy charges and could face the death sentence in tunisia jabeur mejri and ghazi beji were sentenced on march 28 2012 to seven and a half years in prison in morocco mohammed socrates is spending two years in jail for his atheism but the authorities in morocco were smart enough to accuse him of narcotics trafficking and there is no need to say that he confessed under torture one might even include malala yousafzai the 14-year-old girl shot by the pakistani taliban because of her public calls for secularism and female education religions are just collections of beliefs which cant be proved i still cant imagine that in the twenty-first century there are people going to prison because they dont believe that someone walked on water a virgin gave birth to a child or a man flew to heaven on a donkey tolerating this new inquisition moves our world back to the middle ages and this could have devastating consequences for our lives this article was published in english in foreign

42,80,Destroying the Fourth Reich,2012-10-07 00:00:00,Maikel Nabil,,-0.406046,US,destroying the fourth reich >> 07 october 2012 #fullpost{display:inline;} it was 1952 when three months before starting a coup in egypt the so called moslem soldiers changed their name to the free officers in order to conceal their strong ties tothe moslem brotherhood and its leader hassan al-banna two important figures in this coup would subsequently become presidents in the new government: gamal abdel nasser and mohammed anwar al-sadat the latter explicitly admitted in front of the egyptian parliament that both of them cooperated with hassan al-banna in the secret militia of the moslem brothers it is well known that hassan al-banna was keen on nazism during wwii he used the newspaper he had established “al-nazeer” as a tool for supporting the nazi army such was his advocacy that he stated adolf hitler had converted to islam and was supported by allah additionally he amin al-hussieni and their colleges cooperated with the nazi arabic radio which was covering the whole middle east at that time spreading the nazi ideology beyond the complexity of their political relations al-sadat and al-banna shared an obscure affinity for nazism in his diaries “in search of identity” al-sadat admitted having contact with the nazi army in the prospect of cooperation during the wwii when he was a young officer in the egyptian army even when this attitude is open to interpretation in the context of the egyptian search for support against british domination later al-sadat used a tie with the swastika during one of his negotiations with israeli politicians in october 1981 death found him wearing a uniform suspiciously similar to the one used by the “ss” in the light of these precedents it is not surprising that in 1952 nasser and sadat had abolished the egyptian liberal democracy and started a new regime based on social nationalism xenophobia and anti-semitism the signification of symbolism should not be underestimated: the green independence egyptian flag was substituted by a new one exhibiting the 3 nazi flag colors (red white and black) they spread their power to sudan libya yemen tunisia syria iraq and gaza and in every time carrying the same ideology and colors of the nazi flag after the end of wwii the world believed that nazism had ended; they overlooked the establishment of a new nazi regime in the middle east these officers heirs of the nazi ideology started a 4th reich in egypt establishing characteristically oppressive institutions on the same attitude of the gestapo and the ss that’s why it wasn’t a surprise that the nazi war criminal aribert heim was hiding in egypt under cover for decades in addition they expelled 80 thousands of egyptian jews just after robbing their properties and removing their citizenship not being punished by this crime 10 million egyptian christians are their new target disconcertingly this nazi regime is being supported now by israel probably ronald regan was right when he said there is a great similarity between politics and prostitution following the teachings of goebbels a huge propaganda system was assembled in egypt and the arab world in order to manipulate and mobilize the public opinion fully in function until now its consequences have been witnessed by the whole world recently: a political and human crisis triggered by the american amateur movie innocence of moslems unfortunately the nazi legacy has been perpetuated in egypt most of laws promulgated soon after the coup have not been touched till now personally when jailed last year i was judged by laws made in the 1960s the military council ruling egypt until last july didnt touch those laws and mohammed morsi (the moslem brotherhood president) neither did while you are reading this ayman youssef mansour gamal abdou masoud makarem diab said bishoy el-beheri and many others are in egyptian jails because of criticizing islam the activist alber saber currently tried due to the fact that he is atheist could be the most recent case but wont be the last one as long as this nazi regime remains in power not a few of us assume with unbelievable naivety that gone the bad leader everything will be solved that is a dangerous mistake if the nazi army had not been defeated the nazi regime would have lasted even after hitler’s death similarly a little changed in egypt after the outset of nasser sadat mubarak or tantawi the problem is in the regime not in individuals 4 months ago i moved to germany trying to understand this european ideology which infected my country while europe managed to get cured from it by now the most significant fact i discovered is that many germans fought against the nazi regime from inside and tragically all of them failed the intervention of other countries was necessary to overthrow the nazis i suspect that the same goes with the egyptian dictatorship all the attempts to break it down from inside will fail even revolutions won’t work the disregard the world shows for egypt dictatorship’s crimes gives room for its perpetuation i hope the recent attacks on western embassies can serve in history as the attack on pearl harbor the world has to know that if no one decided to face it this dictatorship will remain and will continue exporting hatred and terrorism to the whole world forever adolf hitler with amin al-husseiny in berlin posted by maikel nabil sanad at 11:21 am labels: articles - en 4,joy,0.80411994,0.0,0.0,0.0769230769230769,0.3846153846153846,0.0,0.2307692307692307,0.0,0.1538461538461538,0.0,0.0769230769230769,0.0769230769230769,0.0288248337028824,0.0168310322156476,care,authority,0.2307692307692307,0.3846153846153846

45,83,Egypt & Israel: A New Treaty Is Needed,2012-09-06 00:00:00,Maikel Nabil,,-0.229442,US,egypt & israel: a new treaty is needed >> 06 september 2012 #fullpost{display:inline;} one of the things i hate about the marriage institution is that the rules (the contract) are decided only one time and can’t be updated again i think it’s irrational because life is a dynamic environment everything and everyone change all the time you me and them so how you can make fixed rules for changing things how you can sign some rules when you are 25 and expect that you will like these rules after 30 years when you will be 55 i believe humans should be able to update the rules every day this will make their relations more healthy and successful the same works in politics nations shouldn’t have fixed contracts for their relations with each other look at france and germany after the world war 2 as an example they are updating the rules every day from the european economic area to the eu to the nato …etc every year there is a new update in the rules of the relation between both countries that’s why they are acting as perfect allies and there is no fear on collapsing the peace status between both of them that’s why i don’t like the egyptian-israeli peace treaty anymore it’s a 70s model of contracts which can’t work anymore in the 21 century it became just a piece of paper which can’t protect the peace status any more it’s a fixed contract meant to be a beginning in 1979 but no one cared to update this contract and the sad fact is that both countries can’t live with this contract any more now the treaty is going in one of two directions: either to be updated or to fall egypt double-face authorities oppressing moral people double-face authorities after some egyptian military officers killed the former president mohammed anwar al-sadat in 1981 egyptian authorities don’t consider 1979’s treaty as a peace treaty any more for them it’s a seize-fire deal al-sadat wanted a real peace but they don’t they are still dreaming in making revenge for their successive loses in previous wars against israel after 33 years of the peace treaty israel still doesn’t exist on official egyptian maps when young egyptian students study geography they find only palestine on their state-printed books well israelis don’t exist or at least don’t have the right to exist egypt also haven’t canceled a law was made before the peace treaty which criminalizing zionism and punishing any egyptian zionist by removing his citizenship mubarak who was called “a friend of israel” by lots of israeli leaders was in power for 3 decades and never tried to drop this law and when revolutionaries invaded state security investigation offices in february 2011 they found a department there under the name of “countering zionism” the funny thing is that egyptian authorities never made a definition of zionism so calling for peace could be a crime if the authorities wanted just as they banned “jehovah’s witness” in egypt for their support to peace and co-existence for egyptian authorities it’s just a piece of paper they are still training young officers that israel is their only enemy and forcing young recruits to say every day that “jews are enemies of allah” egypt haven’t opened academic center in israel according to the treaty egyptians have to take permission from “the egyptian military intelligence” if they wanted to visit israel state syndicates still refuse any kind of normalization with israel the state-owned media still run the anti-israel propaganda it was an ex-military officer (not a revolutionary) who said in 2010 that israel send sharks to sharm el-shikh to attack tourists and tourism egyptian intelligence agencies target egyptian peace activists and call them israeli spies exactly like what they did to me never mention facilitating invading the israeli embassy and terrorist attacks on israeli borders moral people on the other hand the egyptian people feel deceived they know that the peace treaty was built on 2 bases: giving sinai back to egypt and making a progress forward in the palestinian-israeli peace process the first base is not going well while some israeli politicians speak about reoccupying sinai or giving it to palestinians you can’t trust someone who is talking about re-invading your country for the third time and gets elected and participates in the government and the other base there is no progress in the peace talks with palestinians it was going good until oslo 1993 and then everything stopped after ariel sharon left the cabinet peace with palestinians is not any more on the agenda of israeli governments the point is thatthe peace treaty was meant to make israel coexist in middle east as egypt not to make egypt isolated in the area as israel egyptians are not anti-semitic people; they are just moral people who can’t stop themselves from caring about palestinians who suffer from occupation and building new settlements on their land my people feels deceived when an israeli leader speak about annexing the west bank to israel or about living with the conflict forever even while we had a perfect palestinian leader who truly believes in peace and the right of israel to exist the way that netanyahu speaks about abu mazen is completely humiliating in a way never used in diplomatic medium this wasn’t our deal and calling for ending the palestinian suffering of course couldn’t be considered anti-semitism or even anti-israel speech it’s israel which risks the peace treaty when it ignores palestinian rights not egyptians when being pro-palestinians israel uncaring leaders ruling scared people uncaring leaders well even israel is a democracy but strangely it acts in the same manner as egypt in israel also there is a gap between reactions of politicians and normal citizens israeli leaders don’t care about building peace relation with egyptians the israeli embassy in egypt doesn’t have a website the israeli academic centre in egypt don’t have arabic page and the english page don’t include contacts i had to use the hebrew page to get information about this socially-inactive hole after all these years no leadership in israel (rightwing or leftwing) cared to open a website for the israeli embassy in cairo or to have arabic information for egyptians about the israeli mission on their land the israeli embassy in egypt acts as if their job to maintain good relation with the egyptian dictatorship not the egyptian people they never invited peace activists to their events just egyptian officials they are more loyal to the egyptian military more than egyptian young military officers i questioned myself to which side these guys belong after a senior official in the israeli embassy in cairo asked me if i have permission from the egyptian intelligence when i wanted to get a visa to israel israeli leaders don’t even care about egypt violations to the peace treaty they never complain they never complained about egyptian security orders to arrest any egyptian who enters the israeli embassy they never complained about egypt blocking official israeli internet websites including sites of the israeli president the prime minister the ministry of foreign affairs and others they never complained about targeting egyptian peace activists they never complained about egypt arrest to normal egyptian citizens and accusing them of treason because of having a mobile number of an israeli citizen saved on their mobile phones and instead of complaining about egypt violations to the peace treaty israel is defending human rights violations in front of the unhrc and packing the egyptian dictatorship in usa maybe they don’t care maybe they enjoy being a victim and maybe something else the egyptian intelligence arrested me 3 days after i said that the netanyahu government is scaring israelis to push israelis to vote for the security agenda of right-wing parties a year later former mossad and schin-bet leaders spoke out against the policy of netanyahu toward iran accused his government of using scare tactics toward the israeli public and said that iran threat is exaggerated maybe some politicians want egypt to be a permanent risk on israel to use the public fear for their own interest maybe scared people israelis remind me with the christian minority in egypt in egypt lots of groups scare christians; salafis moslem brothers military authorities churches holy books even christian human rights activists all of these groups use scare tactics to push christians in the direction they want them to go as a former christian i couldn’t stop being a reaction and start to be an action except when i decided not to put fears in consideration i don’t let fears affect my decisions that’s why i don’t react to scare tactics the same happens with israelis every one scares them israelis are nearly the most scared people on earth they are scared from iran hamas hezbollah al-qaeda israeli arabs the arabic spring nazis arab league anti-zionist jews etc even israeli politicians and peace activists use scare as a way to motivate israelis that’s why israeli elections usually mirror reactions not demands of israelis even the egyptian-israeli peace treaty was a reaction to al-sadat initiative not an israeli initiative i understand how difficult it’s to be an israeli i understand how it’s when you live in a part of the world which praises hitler and considers another holocaust against jews is a good step forward to the resurrection day i understand how it’s to send your kids to a school knowing that this school could be bombed by a terrorist and his people will call him a martyr but still being a reaction converts you into a tool in the hand of the one made the action your enemy calculates your reaction before making his action and most of these scary groups don’t deserve such attention; the iranian regime is falling from inside hamas which don’t even have aircraft won’t throw israel in the sea the moslem brothers in egypt turned to be copies from mubarak there will be no holocaust in the 21 century a jewish friend once told me when i was criticizing israel foreign policies “when my government fails in something i have to do it myself” and i believe this is the right thing to do now after i experienced myself the un-functionality of israeli ministry of foreign affairs i believe israelis need to stop being a reaction to anyone they should decide what the right thing to do and do it without thinking of the sequences if israelis had stood beside arabic revolutions it would have been the best thing happened to israel ever in recent history menachem begin in 1977 didn’t trust al-sadat and wanted to make him leave israel in the first day of his visit but it was the israeli peace groups which made this peace works i believe israelis and egyptians shouldn’t wait their leaders to make a progress i didn’t wait my government the society has to push politicians not the opposite israelis have to vote for politicians based on political agenda not based on fears what’s the idea for a security agenda government while this government apologized to egypt after egyptian authorities facilitated a terrorist attack on israel initiatives for a new treaty with egypt should start from the ground israelis shouldn’t wait until the treaty falls and then forced to make a reaction again final words israel had a peace agreement with egypt in 1956 and the cold peace lasted at that time for 11 years but because it was an agreement with the egyptian authority not egyptian people this agreement fall in a couple of weeks in 1967 the same can happen with 1979’s treaty a piece of paper wouldn’t protect the status of peace between the two nations 1979’s treaty will fall anyway so it’s either making a new treaty now or facing the sequences of falling of the peace treaty while we don’t have another alternative maikel nabil sand – wwwmaikelnabilcom egyptian activist leader of “no for compulsory military service movement” became the first conscientious objector to the military service in egypt in 2010 then the first conscious prisoner to boycott military trials in august 2011 spent 10 months in egyptian prisons last year (with 130 days of hunger strike) because of defending human rights and is nominated for the next noble peace prize this article was published in hebrew and english in haaretz newspaper further readings: my writings about israel and peace in middle east posted by maikel nabil sanad at 10:19 am labels: articles - en 3,trust,0.25855765,0.4036697247706422,0.036697247706422,0.0275229357798165,0.2660550458715596,0.018348623853211,0.073394495412844,0.0,0.110091743119266,0.018348623853211,0.0,0.0642201834862385,0.1195175438596491,0.0181092126551263,loyalty,care,0.110091743119266,0.4036697247706422

Honestly",2012-06-27 00:00:00,Maikel Nabil,,-0.473885,US,me and the other revolutionaries  honestly >> 27 june 2012 #fullpost{display:inline;} pic 1 of 7: maikel nabil the first opinion prisoner after the revolution cruelty do you know what the hardest time i’ve spent incarcerated was what hurt the most … no not the time i’ve tried to slit my wrists with a piece of glass and couldn’t because it wasn’t sharp enough… and wasn’t the night i spent at the same place where they told me that the disappeared journalist reda hilal was assassinated… not also that time where i was physically assaulted by a police officer and the sanctity of my body was violated… and it also wasn’t those moments when they made me watch them torture the other inmates at elmarg prison facility… not the moments when the elmarg police officers where framing me for religious contempt and blackmailing me to stay silent about their violations against me… and not the moments i was so close to death during my hunger strike not the moments when i forgot the names of my friends nor the moments when i started to lose my vision nor the moments following me waking up and not realizing where i was not the moment when i refused to write an apology that would set me free and chose to return to prison with my own free will it wasn’t the moments i cried for my dear friend nour moreb the loyal friend who made sure before he committed suicide to make my picture as his facebook profile picture so as to expose the silence of the world on my incarceration no all those moments were hard but they weren’t the hardest the hardest moment was when i was stepping in the military court from the transportation vehicles while on hunger strike shouting out with the down fall of the military ruling while seeing only two people standing before the court my father and a friend … or when i was standing alone in the court room before the judge without lawyers present while tens of lawyers were in the adjacent hall how many times have i asked to be visited by a human rights lawyer so that he would put an end for the violations happening against me in jail but not one human rights organization responded to my pleas and if it weren’t for amir salem the brave lawyer who helped me transfer by the end of december out of elmarg prison facility i might’ve been killed there as a result of mistreatment inside it was hard when one of the rebels told me about a meeting he had with some of the members of the scaf on february 2011 and how he told them that he was my friend though he didn’t approve of the offences that i directed to the armed forces… the funny thing was that this person regretted it and told me about what happened but how many others did the same thing and never said a word  the rebels were the ones who gave the green light for the army to imprison me the crisis of the egyptian revolution the egyptian revolution missed the presence of a compass… the rebels are moved by their temperaments and the flow of inclination the don’t know what their goals are or what they want… they went out on their way to bring down the regime then gave the power to the army of that regime and surrendered the parliament to the religious wing of the regime then handed the leadership of the revolution to the general intelligence agents… they were fascinated and fooled by media and cable show stars while blinded to the dirty prison uniforms… searching for a hero to free them while oblivious to the freedom existing within them looking for a just ruler among a bunch of thieves… listening to populists and demagogues while not reading for philosophers and intellectuals … they pursue those of gossip rather than those of understanding … a nation that does not read as if knowledge was a vice they put ideological barriers between them and the key to their revolution’s success the move with the herd not the herd of the “sofa party” but the herd of the revolution’s party without asking about the intentions of the alpha male leading this herd some might see me as conceited for saying this (and they are free to do so) but i assume that i would’ve made a difference in the fate of this revolution i might’ve saved a lot of lives and eyes i might’ve shrunk the lifespan of the july military regime i would’ve helped in the victory of this revolution during its early months… the members of the military council knew that well that’s why they started with the procedures of my case since the 2nd week of them assuming power (and perhaps the 1st week) and for those who wonder about the abilities i claim to have they are simply the same points i’ve been attacked on: being atheist my foreign relations my position concerning israel… the world doesn’t feel that i’m odd or different or eastern… my position regarding israel assures everybody that i don’t hate anybody based on their beliefs that i will not cause a new war in the region … my position on religion removes any doubt regarding any relation between me and extremists groups and at the same time confirms my commitment to rational analysis and reasonable thinking… during my conversations with foreign diplomats the conversation always is very straightforward and a lot do those diplomats admit their fault without shame just because they think i’m not a stranger i would have used that so we could stop the arms deals that is constantly supplied to the military council and save the lives and eyes of the rebels this could’ve also been invested to apply pressure to the council to hand over the power during only six months the egyptian government to accept the rome convention  and other international human rights treaties the council would’ve been forced to organize a free election and to hold just courts for all the corrupts of the july system… but all this never happened simply because the revolutionary bodies put their hate for israel before their love for their country and delivered me on a silver platter to the militaries … i believe that it was the rebels were the ones who imprisoned me not the militaries i’ve been tried and imprisoned really early during the revolution at a time were the rebels were influential and if they’ve taken the same reaction they did when asmaa mahfouz and reem maged and others later on i wouldn’t have been imprisoned in the first place a predicament on the night before i was supposed to travel to germany to study (not to immigrate) a friend from the group who were involved in the campaign demanding my freedom she wrote: “i would’ve understood the decision of immigration if you hadn’t called for and were involved in the revolution but since you have done that especially since you are an activist and went and did something controversial and left your friends in a tight spot defending you and ditched us then _l_ pic 2 of 7: i would’ve understood the decision of your immigration if you hadn’t called for and were involved in the revolution but since you have done that especially since you are an activist and went and did something controversial and left your friends in a tight spot defending you and ditched us then _l_ the real crises with the mindset of the egyptian people is that they consider defending opinion prisoners as a tight spot or a predicament it’s not just that we blame the victim and disregard executioner but we also blame those whoever tries to help this victim… i’ve never heard of an african american accusing martin luther king that he “stuck the black community with defending him” nor have i ever read about any african accusing nelson mandela that he has “set” them “up” for defending him for 38 years straight and up till now it never happened that someone from burma said that aung san su kyi has “set” the burmese opposition “up” with defending her… in egypt we consider human rights defenders are “sticking us with their defense” when they defend our rights last month some closely connected people with the egyptian general intelligence administration evoked a campaign against me as a result of my position from terrorism and here i’m not talking about the flow of swearing or provoking of violence but also encouraging the army to imprison me all over again and of course i’m not talking about a difference in opinion although the justification of a terrorist operation is not an opinion… but i’m talking about a new tone here which is them gloating with the fact that they have defended me when i was incarcerated great number of brutes who didn’t read my writings which they curse me for say that they regret participating in the marches of my release… when the defense of free speech becomes something you regret then don’t mind the military shoes diving in your gut let he who has sown the thorns reap it… the person who says “cursed be the principles that would make me defend maikel” is someone who has never believed a day in those principles … and the girl who says “damned be the revolution that would make me defend maikel nabil” is a human who never believed a day in the revolution sometimes i find myself thinking: what did i earn when i entangled myself with 10 months of imprisonment for defending the right s of people whom i don’t know what would i get out of defending the rights of young men refusing compulsory military recruitment although i’ve been irrevocably exempted … did you know that ahmed mustafa the first blogger to be military tried in egypt (year 2010) is almost the only prisoner that i’ve defended during his incarceration and hasn’t humiliate me after his release like the others every time i answer myself with the same replies i did what my conscience command me to and what retains my self-respect… but the most important question that i couldn’t answer: am i prepared to give up my freedom yet again defending a group of people who consider me defending their rights a “predicament” the question i keep asking myself constantly” who has the right to gloat the other … i was invited to the meeting with omar suleiman on february 2011 and i didn’t go while mustafa el-naggar and the muslim brotherhood went and you have elected them for the parliament … i’ve been locked away and tortured in the military intelligence on february the 4th you held your silence and followed wael ghoniem arriving in hossam badrawee’s the secretary general of the national democratic party car saying that the intelligence officers who arbitrary detained him are in fact loyal and patriot men… you praised the army and ignored me during the time when the rebels were tortured and killed in the military camps… you want to hold the salafis accountable for voting “yes” for the referendums on modifications of the constitution and you don’t hold “6th of april” accountable for giving legitimacy to the military council after the coup on mubarak … you consider khalid ali a candidate of the revolution although he accepted the negotiations with the egyptian general intelligence administration with no known results for this negotiations and he has participated in a charade of falsified elections that gave legitimacy for the continued presence of the military ruling and you consider me non representative of the revolution though i’ve refused the invitation to meet one of the military council members and before that i refused to receive a phone call from the prime minister al-ganzoury and before that i refused a position in egyptian ministry of foreign affairs so now talk to me about being revolutionary pic 3 of 7: the youth of 6th april of

he was telling me that america on his side while i’m “the liberal democratic activist” is suffering in jail for more than 6 years i’ve been acting in egypt for democracy individual freedoms human rights peace and against racism wars militarism and discrimination and for this i was arrested 5 times in egypt was beaten and sexually harassed the military invaded my house twice persecuted even the girl they thought she was my girlfriend i’ve spent 10 months during the last year in egyptian prisons with a hunger strike lasted for 130 days after they accused me in front of a military tribunal of “insulting the military” my family and friends were targeted by the military and my father was moved from his job 4 times the last year to harm my financial status and after thousands of activists around the world suffered to get me out of prison the military released me without dropping the charges meaning that they can get me back to prison at any time neither me nor any other revolutionary in egypt thought that our revolution could be transformed to this militarized nightmare we rose against mubarak aiming to live in a free country calling for democratic reform pressuring for protecting the human rights and the dignity of our citizens but instead of that we were killed injured military tried tortured arbitrary detained and targeted in local media and for the surprise of us the egyptian military is backed up by the free world and making these violations under the protection of the usa during my imprisonment i knew about the statements issued by us leaders condemning my detention i even read the letters which senator mark kirk and representative frank wolf sent to me and to field marshal hussien tantawi… but every day i was asking myself what i’m benefiting from these vocal statements while i’m in jail and the egyptian army is oppressing my people with the american weapons during the last year i was following the file of american hostages in egypt it began with ilan grabel the american-israeli citizen who was arrested in egypt for no crime just to be traded for something we don’t know till now and because the free world accepted to be blackmailed and because the egyptian military benefited from blackmailing usa & israel they repeated it again but this time with more than 20 american citizens in the ridiculous case against civil society organizations in egypt these americans were prohibited from leaving egypt for a long time and targeted by state-owned media in egypt with a military anti-american propaganda including great dose of conspiracy theory and anti-semitism after the egyptian military knew that the military aids to egypt won’t be decreased in the next year they allowed these hostages to leave egypt without dropping the case and asking them to be back in 2 weeks to continue their trial procedures it was leaked also that scaf members were using the american hostages as a tool to free the egyptian terrorist omar abdel-rahman an information which opens lots of questions related to international terrorism and the anti-american groups in egypt and after that the pro-scaf activist tawfeek okasha led a demonstration in front of the american embassy in cairo and the revolutionaries feared that his thugs could invade the embassy as what happened before in the israeli embassy and tried to make them leave the area but the american-backed egyptian military attacked these revolutionaries last week i was in geneva to testify in front of the un human rights council asking the council when they will act to make sure that the universal declaration for human rights and the international convention for civil and politic rights is respected and this week i’m here in usa to ask the american leaders if the american tax-payers are cutting from their money to support dictatorships why the egyptian people aren’t allowed to have the same rights and freedoms which the american people have how a democratic country gives weapons to such nazi militarists knowing that they will use it against democratic activists how would you expect that egyptians will consider usa a friendly country if our brothers are killed by the american weapons and if the military aids given to egypt is to support the cold peace between egypt and israel then why egypt didn’t stop targeting peace activists and why egypt didn’t stop the anti-israel propaganda this article was published in the wall street journal in 19 march 2012 posted by maikel nabil sanad at 6:10 pm labels: articles - en 5,anger,0.44030306,0.2258064516129032,0.1935483870967742,0.032258064516129,0.1935483870967742,0.0,0.2258064516129032,0.032258064516129,0.0967741935483871,0.0,0.0,0.032258064516129,0.082010582010582,0.0098161637183489,care,care,0.2258064516129032,0.2258064516129032
48,86,In which side is Israel standing?,2011-03-25 00:00:00,Maikel Nabil,,-0.195627,US,in which side is israel standing >> 25 march 2011 #fullpost{display:inline;} mistaken mistaken whoever believes that in politics borders can isolate nations what happened in tunisia resulted in mubaraks end in cairo what happens in syria & iran decides who will lead the knesset in israel and whats said in tel-aviv decides what usa will make in middle east but obviously this rule isnt liked by those who are saying that israel doesn’t have any other choice except to wait and see who will reach power in egypt: liberals or islamists  or in other words they are saying: dont blame us when it goes bad in cairo because we don’t have anything to do with it… but don’t they israel & security security in any nation is the most important thing to take care of thats why nations are having armies and police forces but israel maybe the only country in the world in which security agenda decides who will be the prime minister so if the anti-israel states in middle east decided to change their position and take the side of peace those who are slaying peace for security in israel wont be in the knesset again thats why some leaders in israel are grateful to hamas and iran for leading them to their positions in the knesset but dont forget israeli friends you have to live in panic fearing from the monsters and aliens surrounding you in middle east or else how would they talk about the security anymore  me & israel on december 2010 i declared that i want to visit israel (for 2 weeks) to build bridges with israeli activists in order to help both nations in managing relations in a better way for the last 4 months israeli officials are refusing to give me a visa to israel and more than 10 activists in israel is trying to get me one and all of them failed even knowing that they represent several israeli institutions and one of them is an active member in a party ruled israel in the past actually i started to believe that mubarak who killed israelis in sinai (in 1973) is more welcomed in israel than me the pacifist who refused to carry a weapon against israel (could have been jailed because of that) israel wouldnt refuse to give mubarak a visa so the lesson which israel wants me to learn that i have to be an enemy of israel to be welcomed in israel just as the terrorists whom israel speaks with in claimed peace talks and yet there are people asking: why those talks usually fail whats happening in cairo every week one of israeli politicians visits egypt but they meet only egyptian militarists they dont meet egyptian liberal secular pro-peace activists but here is the good news: militarists here are giving the rule of egypt to islamists and if we didnt stop this we will have an islamic parliament in egypt by next september so if israel is supporting egyptian militarists and those militarists are supporting islamists then israel is supporting islamists that’s why i’m asking: in which side is israel standing because obviously it isn’t the civil side egyptian militarists are ensuring that they will keep the peace treaty just as they were ensuring that mubarak wont fail and look at it from the other side has iran or turkey declared war against israel there are a big distance between declaring war and supporting terrorism and if egyptian officials had put a bomb in a church in alexandria to kill their own citizens so sure israel can trust that those guys wont support terrorism in israel and you already know from wikileaks that tantawi was training his army for the last 20 years on the bases that israel is the only enemy so what a friend do you have too late understanding in 4 february i published a video on the web advising israel to support the egyptian revolution to win the hearts of egyptians and it was broadcast on israeli tv during following days lots of israelis made fun of me declaring their support to mubarak in the 3rd of march the arabic official site of the israeli ministry of foreign affairs (al-tawasol) published statements of some israeli leaders showing solidarity with pro-democratic movements in middle east but it was too late egyptians dont care about what israeli leaders would say after they said that mubarak is a friend of israel israelis dont understand why egyptians are angry of those words just imagine that im saying that hitler is a friend of egypt bad words isn’t it israeli activist roy arad wrote about how israeli police fined him when he and his friends converted magen david square in israel to another tahrir square to show solidarity with the egyptian revolution what a nice message to send to egyptians and we expect egyptians to love israel final words -

49,87,The army and the people wasn’t ever one hand,2011-03-08 00:00:00,Maikel Nabil,,-0.421328,US,the army and the people wasn’t ever one hand >> 08 march 2011 #fullpost{display:inline;} activists tortured and killed by the army even after mubarak’s resigning (a study supported with documents) the army and the people wasn’t ever one hand is the egyptian army standing beside the revolution on the 11th of february 2011 after the president’s stepping down speech that was delivered by omar suliman (vice-president of the republic and the former head of the egyptian intelligence) many egyptian powers rushed into declaring the victory and the end of the revolution… i regret having to say the following mostly because that many of them are my friends but the people have the right to know the truth… some of them wanted to take advantage of the presence of the supreme council of the armed forces to get some political positions by making deals with the supreme council they knew that they cannot achieve such positions through regular democratic process… and some of them had connections with the secret service before the revolution was declared and supported the secret service institution per default (i don’t want to describe them as secret service’s agents) and some others thought that the army was not a part of the july military regime and therefore was misled by the army declarations (press releases) and have accepted the army’s role in the transitional phase in fact the revolution has so far managed to get rid of the dictator but not of the dictatorship a broad sector of egyptian political elite and rebels share this same vision with me one of them is dr elbaradei who mentioned in his article concerning the current situation in egypt: “the army is leading the transitional phase in a mysterious and monopolizing way” many rebels continued to protest against the armed forces’ will calling for a civilian council instead of supreme council of the armed forces as i participated in the revolution since day one i’ve witnessed the majority of the events in the following study i will present all the evidences and documents which prove that the army did not stand by the people’s side not even once during this revolution and that the army’s conduct was deceptive all the time and that it was protecting its own interests in order to simplify this study i’ve divided the egyptian revolution into three stages that describe the army’s position: the first stage: before saturday january 29 2011 (ie before the army taking over the street) the second stage: from january 29 until the stepping down speech in february 11 2011 (14 days) the third stage: after the stepping down speech (since february 12 until now) the first stage: before saturday january 29 2011 (ie before the army taking over the street) the egyptian revolution started in 25 january 2011 and hundreds of thousands of egyptians took the streets during the first four days of the revolution the police forces faced them with brutality and killed more than 500 protestors and injured more than 6000 in addition to 1000 missing (turned out later that they are behind bars in the ministry of interior) so what was the reaction of the army 1- sami annan the chief of staff of the egyptian army assured the united states of america that the egyptian army is loyal to mubarak and that it would not abandon mubarak in contrary to what the tunisian army did in its report about the egyptian revolution on january 25 2011 the american news website “startfor” (that is specialized in intelligence reports) said: “it’s very little coincidence that the egyptian army chief of staff is in washington right now with the us getting assurances from the egyptian army that the army will not abandon mubarak like the tunisian army did with ben ali” « startfor » did not name the chief of staff in its report and therefore we did not get any confirmation that the person “startfor” mentioned was “sami anan”… until the daily “al-masry al-youm” mentioned on january 30 2011 that the chief of staff of the egyptian army sami annan came back today from the united states of america * startfor changed the data after i published the arabic copy of this research it was written “it’s not a coincidence” and they changed it into “it’s very little coincidence” … so who is very powerful to make startfor change a topic written from 40 days … sadly i didn’t take a print screen of the startfor topic before change 2- the army provides the police with live bullets to kill the demonstrators on january 28 on january 28 2011 hundreds of thousands of egyptians took the streets to the tahrir square after friday prayers the police confronted them with tear gas and smoke bombs as well as rubber and live bullets  the battle between demonstrators in the tahrir square and the police forces last around 10 hours (from 2 pm until about midnight)  friday’s evening after six o’clock the police forces stationed next to the parliament councils stopped the shooting for they ran out of ammunition after few minutes the protesters saw military policy jeeps passing through them and heading towards the sieged police forces and then returned again… and after the departure of military police jeeps the police forces started firing live bullets at the demonstrators until they ran out of ammunition again… and this is how the same scene was repeated with military police jeeps passing through demonstrators to provide live ammunition to the police so they start firing again… and at that point the demonstrators realized that the army is not on their side so theyve set on fire two jeeps belonging to the military police and an armored vehicle belonging to the armored corps and captured four tanks the second stage: from january 29 until the stepping down speech in february 11 2011 (14 days) since the early hours of saturday 29th of january 2011 and after the demonstrators detained some of the army tanks and burnt the armors the armed forces realized that they will not bear fighting the egyptian revolutionaries … this is when the armed forces started to change the tone with the demonstrators the army officers started speaking to the demonstrators calming them pacifying them hence a new phase of the relation between the revolutionaries and the army started not based on direct clashes but it was based on managing the conflict through indirect mechanisms such as: 1- blockade of the revolutionaries and preventing the demonstrations from leaving el-tahrir square in the first few days especially towards the direction of the ministry of interior and the parliament councils … however things got out of control the last three days of mubaraks rule before his resignation and thats when the army accepted the de facto of the demonstrators marching from the square based on its policy of not having a direct clash with the revolutionaries 2- the continuous threat of using the force: - on the 30th of january the army tried –for no reason- to let-in a fire car into el-tahrir square the demonstrators thought it was going to be used for dispersing them with water splashes thus they stopped it that was when the army officer inside the fire car shot twice in the air to terrorize the demonstrators - the same attitude happened on the 25th of february when a senior officer threatened one of the demonstrators saying: i will kill you 3- passive neutrality: the army has launched many statements claiming that it will protect the protestors; however the role of the army didnt continue behind launching statements after the second speech of mubarak at the night of tuesday february the 1st huge groups of thugs flooded the streets chanting for mubarak to stay and the army was still neutral and during the following two days on the 2nd and 3rd of february the thugs attacked the demonstrators with camels and horses which resulted in the death of 10 martyrs and the injury of over than 1500 demonstrator the army stood passively neutral and let the thugs and the snipers attack the revolutionaries the thugs were also let climb the buildings overlooking el-tahrir square to throw molotov cocktails on the demonstrators the army was simply mimicking the role of the police days before letting the thugs attack the demonstrators so they could be guilt-free the army id say participated in this attack with its negativity and ignoring the security and the protection of the citizens 4- the involvement of the egyptian intelligence in a trial to use some politicians to incite the revolutionaries to leave el-tahrir square one of the documents that was leaked from the state security headquarter in nasr city after breaking in on the 5th of march reveals that a major in the armed forces named khalid mohamed mohsen sharkawy visited the secretary general of the arab league amr mousa asking him to speak to the demonstrators to leave el-tahrir square which is what actually happened; amr mousa went to the square and asked the demonstrators to accept what mubarak offered in his 2nd speech the question is: if the army has really joined the revolution why does the intelligence do the effort to break it down and if the intelligence sector was working against the revolution why didnt the army put an end to these deviations the document leaked from state security 5- on the 3rd of february the military police broke into the office of amnesty international organization and hesham mubarak center for human rights and other international human rights centers confiscated their files arrested their leaders and they delivered the ones who happen to be there to the thugs to be beaten up 6- the military police arrested so many activists collaborating with the state security and thugs; on january the 30th malek adly was arrested on february the 3rd the blogger sand monkey was arrested on his way –with medical aids- to el-tahrir square a few hours later his blog was blocked on the 4th of february wael abbas the blogger and i were arrested and on the 6th of february the blogger kareem amer was arrested… some estimated that the number of demonstrators who got arrested during these two weeks was over than 10000 detained in tens of military detention places in cairo and other areas of egypt the most important of those were the military prison in the hike-step area and the military intelligence in nasr city in front of tiba mall those demonstrators told stories after they were released about torturing and killing of many other demonstrators by the officers of the army and the intelligence and here are some testimonies: a- my personal testimony: one of the military tanks arrested me on the 4th of february next to dar el qadaa el aaly- the supreme court on my way to el-tahrir square i was then delivered to the military police and then to one of the army barracks and then i was delivered to the military intelligence in nasr city in front of tiba mall i was beaten up more than once and sexually harassed and all the day i was listening to voices of other detained demonstrators screaming out of pain and torture (full details here) day two after i was released my father was punished also by changing his position at work b- the report of the the guardian” which published a report on demonstrators who were detained and tortured in the egyptian museum in el-tahrir square and a testimony of a demonstrator named ashraf who was arrested on his way to el-tahrir carrying medical aids and then he was tortured and sexually harassed and threatened to be raped and killed a third testimony for another demonstrator who was arrested beaten up electrified and then he was sent to abdeen police station in downtown cairo where he was beaten up for more than half an hour once he entered the police station c- the testimony of mohamed ibrahim el saeed ibrahim that was documented by the blogger amira el tahawy” mohamed is a young man from alexandria who was on his way to visit his mother in the hospital but he was arrested by the army and detained at the third area military camp mohamed and his fellows were subject to torture with whips metal bars continuously splashing water on them he was screened on state-run-television as one of the thugs that the army arrested mohamed was moved to more than one prison and during his period of detention many demonstrators were murdered d- the report of amnesty international organization that included testimonies of young people who were arrested and tortured by the military police with whips and electric shocks it also includes a testimony of a young man who was detained and tortured at nasser military academy in agouza area giza e- the testimony of kareem amer the blogger kareem was arrested by the military police on the 6th of february 2011 by the military police and he was detained with the colleague sameer eshra at the military prison at the hike-step area kareem wrote after being released about the torture crimes in the prison and how the demonstrators were tortured by the whips and electric shocks and water splashes every now and then despite the cold weather and on the 10th of february 2011 the military prison released 3000 demonstrators on a deserted road without their items after being splashed with cold water it was 3 am when this happened a man was tortured by the army photo by el-nadim center 7- the army tried to invade into el-tahrir square more than once during the period from the 4th to the 10th of february 2011 to kick the protesters out this resulted in many clashed between the protesters and the army one of those was the clash at the night of the 6th of february when the troops next to the egyptian museum tried to make some progress into the square but they were met by the protesters who made human chains to prevent the troops so the army shot in the air threatening them and arrested 3 protesters till this moment we have no information about these 3 protesters the third phase: after the stepping down speech (since february 12 until now) after the stepping down speech the army adopted a media style conveying a message that they joined the revolution but at the same time they did everything to ensure suppression of the revolution or at least to guarantee that it won’t gain any extra privileges 1- the control of incorporeal affairs over media the incorporeal affairs department is one of the egyptian armys departments its normal job is to preserve the general incorporeal status of the nation during war time since the coup d’état in 1952 all the armed sections diverted from their main course of their jobs and it’s known that there were investigations done to officials in the intelligence agency after the 1967 defeat safwat al-sherif was among the investigated officers this was done because of the sexual immoral deviations of the intelligence the incorporeal affairs diverted from its role as well it became a repressive department of which its main role was to deceive the nation and control public opinion when i visited the incorporeal affairs in april 2010 the leading officials were bragging about how they are controlling the public opinion and directing the groups and individuals trends a- the first thing the incorporeal affairs did was to ban photography in el-tahrir square the aim was to isolate the rebels emotionally away from the other egyptian people so the revolutionists that were harshly attacked started to feel that they got abandoned by their own people on the other hand the rest of egyptians started to wonder for what reasons are those other people revolting as they have no idea of how strongly they were being suppressed and attacked photography is banned according to army orders b- on feb 15th 2011 some officials in the higher council conducted a meeting with chief editors of newspapers and media icons and gave clear orders to stop any discussions of mubarak’s wealth the council requested also to help in improving the image of policemen towards the evening of the same day egyptians were shocked to find that all talk shows hosted policemen trying to polish their image and claimed that there was intruders amongst rebels and this obliged them to use live bullets as a self-defense c- on feb 16th 2011 the army created a page on facebook using a very emotional speech trying to draw people to their side and promote for its lies d- the ia (the incorporeal affairs) exploited its own men working in national newspapers and independent ones in polishing and brightening the history of higher council officials one of the most crudest reports was the one published by the 7th day newspaper (al-youm al-sabe3) under the title field marshal tantawy: the second military governor in the history of egypt and hero of the three wars forgetting that tantawy was the defense minister during mubarak’s rule for 20 years and before this was the chief of national republic guard for 3 years e- on 26th feb 2011 the ia assigned major general tarek el-mahdi (one of ia members) as a general supervisor over the television and radio union which led to egypt entering a phase of directed media by a perverse department inside the army tarek el-mahdi started his job very soon after he was assigned (on the 27th feb 2011) by excluding mahmoud saad and interrogating him in addition to distorting saads reputation this happened after saad refused to do an interview with ahmad shafik (the prime minister who is assigned by mubarak and refused by the nation) the funniest thing was that al-masry al-youm newspaper after posting the news about saads interrogation deleted the news feed this opens a question on what was the pressure imposed on the newspaper to ban such a piece of information from people f- smss used to steer the nation the army forced the mobile companies to send smss to people one of the silliest sms was one saying “we waited for 30 years; there is no harm in waiting for just a little bit more while the truth is that people have kept silence with this dictatorship for 59 years not 30 egypt has been the prisoner of such tyranny since the july coup d’état in 1952 and mubarak was merely the extension of this system the army used the sms to threaten people in order not to participate in sit ins the army even incited people to stand to rebels sms like “it is the sit in of some sections although conditions are normal is what is holding us from stepping forward or” it’s the duty of decent patriots to stand in the face of irresponsible individuals the sms were used as well to sweet talk people without any tangible improvements like “we are fully aware of peoples needs and working hard to meet the expectations 2- dispersing the demonstrations by force in tahrir square: one day after the president’s declaration of leaving his position the army started to repeat the same intelligence discourse that was repeated after each of the three presidential speeches it started telling the demonstrators: you triumphed and the revolution is over so go back to your homes production should be resumed bla bla bla … etc such discourse signifies that the revolution should stop army officer ordering demonstrators to leave a- on february 12th 2011 the military police forces intervened by force at night assisted by some thugs and state security agents they assaulted the demonstrators stole some computers of the people’s committees and it were said that one of the demonstrators died while he was battered b- starting february 12th the army banned photographing in tahrir square so that no one would know about the massive violence committed by the army on february 13th while i was in tahrir i saw one of the demonstrators carrying a label that reads “photography is banned according to army orders” “since when do revolutionaries take orders from the army” i asked him he replied by complaining to me from the violence committed by the army against the demonstrators a day earlier and that this lead to the withdrawal of some demonstrators from the square so that the army became able to intervene violently with the remaining smaller number of the demonstrators c- on february 13th 2011 the military police battered some people who were protesting in tahrir square al-jazeera channel broadcast a live video of the military police using thick sticks in an attempt to disperse the protestors who were sitting-in d- on february 14th 2011 the violence committed by the army reached a high peak the army succeeded in dispersing all sorts of demonstrations in the square tens of injured persons were carried to qasr al-ainy hospital the military police injured them during forcibly dispersing the demonstrations then the army published a statement in which it warned the citizens against demonstrating e- on february 16th 2011 the blogger wael abd el fattah quoted bothaina kamel a media lady about the violent assault of the military police against a group of youth near ramsis central communication office f- on february 21st 2011 some people of suez gathered in front a military zone to ask about their kids who were arrested by the army and were not released even after mubarak left his position the army dispersed them violently meanwhile a tank hit the egyptian woman i’tidal ahmed ghouneim and killed her on spot on the following day one of the army leaderships apologized to the demonstrators in front of the same military zone and promised to organize a court trial for the tank driver however did any of you ever heard about the trial of this soldier or did any of those arrestees were ever released up till this day no one knows g- the army repeated its violence on february 25th 2011 as the army leaderships in tahrir square refused to allow the establishment of any tents or stages one of them even threatened to kill the demonstrators (see the video here) after 7 pm the army cut the electric supply to the square in preparation to what was planned to happen by midnight after midnight military police forces aided by sa’iqa and private forces attacked the demonstrators violently they battered them with thick iron wooden sticks and electrified whips the demonstrators were forcibly dispersed and many of them were arrested o as regards this last incidence it is worth mentioning to refer to the testimony of the blogger mohammed moussa mohammed is an activist who participated in the sit-in in front of the cabinet building on february 25th 2011 he was arrested and tortured with some other revolutionaries by the military police in the early hours of february 26th though there are more relevant details about torture yet the most interesting is that the military police soldiers accused the revolutionaries of being paid by some foreigners to attack mubarak moreover the military police officers forced the revolutionaries to yell in support of mubarak it is worth mentioning that such details took place on february 25th two weeks after mubarak left his presidential position h- on february 26th 2011 morning the supreme military council posted a statement on its facebook page stating that the clashes that happened on the day before were not intentional and that no orders were given to carry them out were the sa’iqa and private forces present in the square by mere chance and why did not the army interrogate the officers who violated the military orders it was a very deceptive statement it did not pay any apology and it stated that the clashes were not intended (ie they were friendly firing) it was deceptive also when it gave the day february 25th the name “the friday of loyalty” in spite of the fact that it was a friday of purifying the system not of declaring the people’s loyalty to mubarak the army deleted this statement after the youth expressed their rage about it on the facebook and they posted an alternative statement carrying the same number (22) but without mentioning the term friday of loyalty nevertheless on saturday noon when the army statement was being posted on the facebook and when the secret intelligence authority agents were copying it and saying that the army apologized the army was forcibly dispersing a demonstration in tahrir square by hitting the demonstrators with thick and electrified sticks friday of loaylty the amended version of the statement in this statement the army is lying because if the supreme military council gave orders to release the revolutionaries why did amr al-behairie was sentenced to imprisonment two days only after the release of this statement o it is worth mentioning that the army used the same logic in its treatment of most of the demonstrations all over the country on february 16th 2011 the armed forces besieged the employees of the manpower offices who were sitting-in in front of the ministry of manpower in nasr city and attempted to forcibly disperse them… in the same day the armed forces prevented the journalists from entering mahala textile company [to cover the sit in of its laborers] as well as preventing the second shift laborers from joining their fellows inside the company and ordering them to return to their homes… and on february 14th 2011 the armed forces published a statement saying that they will never tolerate any demonstrations of sit-ins on march 3rd 2011 the military police arrested 20 ebesco laborers and battered one of them 3- the army continues to detain and torture activists who participated in the revolution although the

2011… al nadim uncovered the detention of around 1000 protesters arrested by the police during the first days of the revolution and who are still detained in al wadi al gadeed prison (without any legal procedures)… one day prior to that the minister of interior mahmoud wagdy (who is supported by the armed forced) declares on tv that there were no detainees who had participated in the revolution… note that the number of missing people from january 28 were around 1000 protesters which means that those missing protesters were forcefully detained by the ministry of interior with the knowledge and approval of the armed forces… also worthy of mention that on february 13th the armed forces sent a group of officers to tahrir square to convince the protesters to evacuate the square i told one of the officers that we want the release of all detainees; he then told me that the detainees will not be released until we evacuate the square (this means that the detainees were kept as hostages to get us to evacuate the square) the strange thing is the square was evacuated a few days after that and the detainees have not yet been released to this day and we fear that the ministry of interior might kill all the detainees to erase all traces of its crimes e- mrs ayda seif el dawlas testimony (al nadim center) on some of the previous detainees who were detained again after mubarak

51,89,The Story of 2 Days I spent at the Egyptian Intelligence,2011-02-09 00:00:00,Maikel Nabil,,-0.293516,US,the story of 2 days i spent at the egyptian intelligence >> 09 february 2011 #fullpost{display:inline;} we are against what the army are doing to steal our revolution last friday the 4th of february at night i was arrested at one of the headquarters of the egyptian intelligence they were covering my eyes and there was a group of intelligence officers making conversations with many egyptian activists who were arrested as me (9 of them were arrested while going out from el-barada’i home) one of the intelligence officers told me in front of them “if we collected those 20 activists it would be 10% of what you did” so i replied “i am a humble person and i see that all of them are better than me” before that when i was writing about me being arrested or any abuse being practiced against my rights i considered this a type of an nonviolent war between me and the regime meaning that that abuse my rights and i reply back by exposing them in front of the world and the exposing usually makes good effect but this time i’m writing in a different way because this is the first time i feel that i’m a victim and the first time i would be insulted that much i’m writing this time not to take revenge but to let people know what would happen to them if this revolution failed our revolution will protect us from these actions to be repeated against me and all of you friday 4th february – in front of the high court - i was heading to el-tahrir in the noon of friday feb 4th to attend the protest i went out from gamal abdlenaser metro station army officer standing beside a tank stopped me in the way to el-tharir sq and searched me 3 times took my banners my mobile and my id then asked me to wait - “civil state not religious or military”  ” no for omar soliman or ahmed shafik “ ” 59 years are enough army” and ” my name is maikel and will demonstrate despite the pop shenoda said” was some slogans on my banners army officers were stopping any one with bags and i saw them not allowing people with medical aids - i asked to speak to someone higher and he pointed his finger to some one civilian told me he’s an intelligence officer i went to him wondering why are you not allowing me to enter while omar soliman and ahmed shafik pledged to allow protesting he said “we have direct orders to don’t allow protesters to enter” then he tied me from my back and connect me to the tank people started to ask why i’m tied to the tank i started to speak to them so the intelligence officer took me to beside revoli cinema theater to be away of people i didn’t give up and started to chant against hosni mubarak and tell protesters to tell media that i got arrested the intelligence officer came and slapped me on the face and what really depressed me that people in the popular committees were helping the army to arrest me thinking that the army is standing by us the way to unit 9770 c7 - a military police car with 440700 numbers came and took me with a military police captain his name is” mokhtar” this captain was helping police by ammo in the friday of angry jan 28th and then protests set his car in fire he was insulting protesters along the way to our distention and he beaten me on the head several times i was surprised that he was passing on the popular committees with greeting some other civilian intelligence officers with some other mubarak thugs and they were planning to arrest people heading to el-tahrir sq - he drove his car through el-sharabya then stopped in a military area carrying the name” unit 9770 c7 “ there were lots of arrested demonstrators there there were also lots of foreigners whom they ordered to leave the unit without their passports (because they burned their passports) - at about 3:30 pm they tied my hands again behind me and tied a cloth over my eyes then they put me in a microbus with other arrested demonstrators then we moved toward our unknown destination the car of officer mokhtar which the revolts burned in the intelligence headquarters - after around 30 minutes driving the car stopped in an open silent place and it stopped there around 4 hours we didn’t know where we are and nobody told us anything there was a near mosque was praying “elasr” and “elesha” army officers were really giving attention to me because i was the only politician with political slogans in this group captain mokhtar was motivate others against me we were hearing voices of people getting tortured officers around me were speaking about someone had been shoot in his leg because he tried to escape and he was bleeding without any help - they bring me alone away of others and ”el-zaffa” started ” el-zaffa” is an expression will-known by the old arrested people in egypt and “el-zaffa” is about high dose of beating and scaring that are given to new political prisoners someone was catching my nick and forced me to be bending over and lots of beating sounds around me and some old intelligence officer was saying rejoiced words - an army officer came to me and said this is the headquarter of state security department to remove suspicions about intelligence or army” and threatened me to be tortured if i didn’t complied with orders he said “be quiet” every few minutes some army officer was coming to me and asking about my name my address where i got arrested and if answered the other officer beats me saying ” i said be quiet ” and if i didn’t answer he beats me and says ” answer” and they kept doing the same stuff for around 30 minutes - then they started to move me and put me in different places and every few minutes some army officers come and speak to me for a while i’ve spoken to around different 10 army officers in that night i think they were recording by video cam this happened till 230 am which means more than 6 hours of investigations they speak with me about my pacifism my refusal to the military service and why this revolution must be ended because the president did all what we asked about - investigations with each activist and been heard by some other activist deliberately i have heard some investigations with others and i believe the same thing happened with me they were targeting to be heard while saying what they want after all torture we got and when activists listen to each other will lose their respect to their selves that’s why when they met me with some youth from el-barada’i campaign i said these youth are heroes and better than me i did that because i want to confirm that we all respect each-others - it was very clear that all officers have personal loyalty to mubarak i was very sad about the egyptian army because it has loyalty to a dictator i envy tunisia about its army - there was a very sassy army officer i think he was the same person that received me by beating in” el-zaffa” he told me that he’s 50 years old; he seemed to be a leader in the intelligence he said ” would you serve in the army maikel ” i said ” no” then he started discussing me about my pacifist beliefs  they didn’t respect the freedom of belief he said “you’ll serve in the army” i said that won’t happen” he said “you’ll get court-martial” i said ” i choose by myself to get court-martial when i refused to serve in the army so it’s ok to get it now” also he was very nervous from the foreign persons i contact through my email it seems they’re no happy with my work with the pacifist european organizations  - they were playing the old ” good officer” and ” evil officer” game a one dealing with us in a bad way and the other one dealing in a very kind way - they were ridiculing on christianity all the time they gave care to know if i’m orthodox catholic or protestant and they listen me to the lord’s prayer - they used to assert always that there’s no law here to protect us and they can make with us however they want honestly it was true we were treated as captured enemy soldiers at war all the time we were tied from our backs blinded blending over don’t know where we are and we were not allowed to speak with each others it’s really not the way to deal with good citizens in their homeland - at 230 am they let me sleep alone on open air on ground i wasn’t with others ” like solitary” they didn’t give me a blanket like others but gave me a carpet and it was very rough all my hands had been hurt because of it - i spent around 29 hours till i been freed in the second day but i was unblinded only in the toilet and this was the time that i know what time was sexual harassment - the first sexual harassment i got was from a small officer that arrested me in downtown he searched my genital but i passed this situation as a part of searching - second in ” el-zaffa” when they was catching my nick and making me blend over and someone from the back trying to lowered my jeans to give me impression that i’ll be raped - third conscripts were taking me from officer to other one of them entered his hands inside my jeans and held me from my boxer - they were dealing with me like a female some officer was speaking to his colleague like” i’ll come to you after i finish with her” - i faced higher officers with that stuff and they acted like they don’t know but in the second day these things stopped freedom again saturday feb 5th 2011 - in the second day we spent till 230 pm in open air place and it was raining but they didn’t give a damn to move us to a different place at 230 they moved me to the prison area they were releasing many people it was around 8 prisons each floor the building was two floors ” around 16 prison” which means that they had over 300 prisoners one prison had arrested female demonstrators and they weren’t allowing the girls to go to the toilets - they were releasing everybody and put me in a corner without knowing what will happen to me they were also bringing new arrested people that confirming the fake of ahmed shafik and omar soliman statements at 630 pm they put handcuffs in my hands i scared because it was the first time in two days (they were tying me with a rope before) they well blinded my eyes and they woke me long time in sand i felt they will shoot me” they were criminals’ but they stopped a cab put me inside and asked me not to open my eyes except after minutes i was only caring to go out this place alive two days with lots of scare and pain i don’t want anyone to get similar experience in his/her life after the cab drove for a while i unblinded my eyes to see myself in el-tayaran st in nasr city so i knew that i was in some military place in raba’a el-adawya in nasr city my last,joy,0.5202283,0.131578947368421,0.0789473684210526,0.131578947368421,0.3421052631578947,0.0,0.131578947368421,0.0,0.0789473684210526,0.0263157894736842,0.0,0.1578947368421052,0.051490514905149,0.0108110187750076,care,authority,0.131578947368421,0.3421052631578947
52,90,Statement: I Would Not Serve in the Egyptian Army and I Bear the Consequences,2010-10-21 00:00:00,Maikel Nabil,,-0.245185,US,statement: i would not serve in the egyptian army and i bear the consequences >> 21 october 2010 #fullpost{display:inline;} i can accept that i would be forced to lose my freedom but i’m not ready to give it up with my own free will last monday 18th of october i was informed with the final decision by the egyptian military institution to nominate me as a reserve officer for the armed forces it is supposed that i deliver myself to the recruitment area to where i am included on next friday (22nd of october 2010) to be transferred to the college of reserve officers at fayed ( ismailia ) to start a compulsory military service for 3 years during the last period i was thinking too much of the correct decision which i have to take in that situation i am a liberal activist since 2005; i have called for the ideas of individualism and individual liberties i talked and wrote too much against the military regime of the 23th of july 1952 i criticized the ideas of nationalism and the fascism that took over the egyptian policies ever since the militarists came to power i talked and extremely defended the right of both of the societies of egypt and israel to co-exist peacefully to end the state of the continued conflict between them i refused the continued harassment which the egyptian regime does against israel as getting involved in without a justification in the 1948 war as well as the assault of the egyptian regime on the right of israel in the navigation in the international straits and the egyptian regime’s support for terrorists who do violent activities against the israeli citizens in april 2009 i have founded the movement no for compulsory military service” (arabic: لا للتجنيد الإجبارى) as the first egyptian movement to promote for pacifism the right of the egyptians in the conscientious objection and the superiority of the voluntary recruitment compared to the compulsory recruitment i thought too much and my decision was that i would refuse to do the military service in egypt and i would bear the consequences whatever they would be despite of my knowledge that the consequences would be a misfortune as i am considered the first egyptian youth to reject the compulsory military service because of my pacifist beliefs my decision has many reasons: - of which i am pacifist against holding weapons against joining the military formations and paramilitary accepting the recruitment would be coercion against my conscientious beliefs and my humanistic principles i am not ready to go against my conscience and beliefs no matter what is the price - also i am not ready for being a piece of chess in the race to armament and the conflicts with the floods of blood which immerses the region i am not ready for being holding a weapon against an israeli youth compulsory recruited who defends the existence of his country i am not ready for being just a number that generals would play with in the business of warfare in the middle east - additionally i consider the compulsory recruitment as a type of slavery and i am a free person i struggled for long years for my freedom i struggled against my family my religious group the society and the police i paid the price of my freedom very well and i won it right now i am not ready for giving up my freedom with my own hands to military gangs all they can do is to kill slaughter and bloodshed i am more virtuous than taking instruction of military people - above all i am aware to the size of the intelligence publicity in which the military institution did against me for all the past period of time and their consecutive accusations against me with being an agent treason and working for the interests of foreign bodies after that sizable fierce publicity i have become afraid on my life and my bodily safety in the armed forces especially under circumstances of a law establishment which prevents existence of inspection for the violations which happen inside the military institution under the circumstances of the existence of the military court which isn’t neutral and which is part of the military institution that accuses me with the previous accusations my carefulness on my life and my bodily safety make me accept years in prison more than risking being subjected to being assassinated inside the army but my words don’t mean that i am an evader of the military recruitment i am rejecting not evading i live in the same address written on my identification card which is known to the administration of recruitment and mobilization the military security forces and the intelligence which also is written in my letters to minister of defense the prime minister heads of both houses of parliament and the president of the republic i am not hiding anywhere so the egyptian police can arrest me anywhere and i am fully prepared to deliver myself to justice once i am being informed that i am wanted i only want to ensure that i am still a civil person (according to the egyptian legal system) the person becomes a soldier after getting a conscript card handing it to his unit and wearing the military uniform nothing of the previous happened to me i am here assuring that i’m a civil person it hasn’t happened to me that i joined the armed forces so i have the right to be tried in front of a civil court any attempt to try me in front of a military court represents a violation against my rights as a civil person also assuring my legal position that i am legally absent from the military service (not an evader) and the absent has no legal punishment except that when he goes to be recruited afterward he would be recruited for one additional year subsequently the military institution has no right to arrest me or make a lawsuit against me on not going to be recruited in the specified date i know that my decision means that i will pay a very high price it means that i will lose my political rights for my whole life it means that i won’t be able to travel outside of egypt for a long time it means that i will find difficulty to work because i don’t have the military certificate it means that i will constantly become subjected to harassment by police forces above all i may be subjected to imprisonment more than once and for long periods of times but freedom has a price and i am a free person i have no objection on paying the price of my freedom with sacrifices such as this great democracies were established in europe and america - sacrifices of the american activists in the 1970s and the consecutive sentences of imprisonment that were held against them were the price that was paid for the united states retrieval of the vietnam war and to end the military service in america - sacrifices of activists in east europe that some were killed and many others were imprisoned to stop the ethnic slaughterings in europe to change europe from a place of ethnically grinding to a strong european union practicing a very respectable role in the international politics also having very high standards for human rights not even found in america - sacrifices of the pacifist israeli soldiers who were subjected to too much imprisonment so that they would not hold a weapon in our faces their sacrifices don’t deserve from me less than having to take the same position and to refuse to hold a weapon against their faces i am part of the movement of the peoples that chose peace and refuse war and blood with my position i am glad to record a new position in the history of egypt between the military institution and the egyptian citizens i hope that the day comes when the egyptian military goes back to its barracks and to stop interfering in politics so egypt would be transformed into a civilian country without powers of military people on civilians and so that the military trials would be abolished the traveling permissions censorship by the intelligence on newspapers and its role in the political conflict protecting the military regime i wish that the day would come that egypt would be transformed into a secular liberal state respecting the individualist values peace the freedom of choice for individuals and to adopt the concepts of professionalism and modernity in its philosophy for forming its national army maikel nabil sanad 20 october 2010 related topics (english) overview on: no for compulsory military service movement letter to the high commissioner for human rights this statement in war resisters international related topics (arabic) no for compulsory military service join us to the group: no for compulsory military service no to compulsory recruitment – an overview 10 reasons making jail better than army delay your recruitment with the national democratic party the egyptian television attacks the leaders of no to compulsory recruitment movement new campaign: recruits should be allowed to use cell phones the conscientious right to object the military service a campaign of sending letters to egyptian and international officials rejecting the military service a letter to the minister of defense on rejection for military service another letter to the minister of defense asking for the exception of the military service a letter for prime minister on rejecting the military service letters to heads of both houses of parliament letters to the president of the republic on rejecting the military service a letter to the high commissioner of human rights for the un videos seminar: the compulsory recruitment between rejection and accepting an episode on bbc arabic on compulsory recruitment posted by maikel nabil sanad at 12:34 am labels: articles -

54,92,Overview on: No for Compulsory Military Service Movement,2010-06-16 00:00:00,Maikel Nabil,,-0.067334,US,overview on: no for compulsory military service movement >> 16 june 2010 we are an egyptian movement established on facebook in 9th of april 2009; against the egyptian laws of military service we aim to abolish compulsory draft and replace it by optional conscription we also are aiming to reform the relation between citizens and military institution ending any authorities of militarists on civilians deepening the civil state and evolving qualification organization and standard liberties and rights in egyptian army our movement is politically neutral its founders and members belong to several and bulk of political movements and there&#8217;s no any political intention for this movement except exterminating compulsory military service all the members of our movement are egyptians and we have lots of friends from many other countries all of them act to abolish military service in their countries in 1952 egypt faced a coup d&#8217;état by some contingent of army soldiers blockaded the royal palace and forced the king to leave egypt then they canceled the egyptian constitution of 1923 declared egyptian republic commandeered newspapers and repealed political parties since that day and till now egypt is under military rule soldiers governing it one by one  till now militarists still control everything in civilian life and damn on miserable way anyone who dares and think of objecting the military government egypt has a compulsory military service law forces every egyptian male (only males) to serve in the egyptian army for a period from 1 to 3 years without any fees and this period could extend more than that if the conscript had a military trial in the army why do we refuse compulsory military service 1- because its just a shape of slavery it takes away freedom of the citizens and forces them to do what they never wanted or choose 2- because its a forced labor system it forces conscripts to work against their will and without charge 3- because its a violation of individual freedom we believe that every citizen is free to choose and decide everything belongs to him and this of course includes his choice to join armed forces or not 4- because it encroach civil state it gives militarists authority on civilians and this contrary to principles of civil state 5- because the concept of the armies around the world has evolved over time and the best armies now are professional ones not the forcibly conscripted armies 1- abolishing compulsory military service and replacing it with optional recruitment 2- ending all military authorities on civilians like (military trials traveling permission and military appointment in civilian sites) 3- allowing the press to monitor military performance exposing any corruption in the army (repeal of the law of: prohibition of the dissemination of any information on the armed forces) 4- guarantee conscripts right in egyptian army by all means and ways to ensure their safety dignity and freedom 5- abolition of all types of racial discrimination within the military establishment (either on the basis of sex religion race family status or any other reason) our mechanisms: 1- electronic campaigns especially on social networks to convey the idea to the maximum percentage of egyptian youth 2- printed brochures posters and stickers to disseminate and clarify the objectives of the movement 3- holding seminars lectures and workshops in political parties human rights organizations in the different provinces to spread our ideas and train activists 4- litigation in the egyptian and international courts to erase legitimacy of the current military service laws and urge the parliament to draft a new law that respects individual freedoms 5- political alliances and political argument with stakeholder and all political movements 6- provide international cover for the movement to ensure communication between the opponents to compulsory recruitment in egypt with their counterparts in other countries to achieve mutual support and to protect the egyptian activists from the terrorism of the egyptian government 7- peaceful demonstrations strikes and sit-ins in public places in front of parliament international institutions and institutions of the army 8- legislative and parliamentary pressure by persuading lawmakers with the ideas of our movement and to persuade them to submit an alternative law to the parliament for discussion legal aspect: we see that compulsory military service law in egypt is unconstitutional and loose legitimacy for the following reasons: 1- sex discrimination because military service is compulsory for males while females are exempted from it 2- religion discrimination since the law reduces the duration of service for the holy quran keepers 3- military service restricts the right of citizens to travel which undermine freedom of movement and the right of emigration which had been endorsed by the constitution and international conventions 4- military service law prohibits recruits and who didnt perform military service from possession of political rights and this is contrary to the principles of equality among citizens 5- constitution confirms that the army is the only institution which has the right to undertake the organization of military and paramilitary formations while the police operates a paramilitary organization (central security) and forces recruits to join it 6- international covenants imposes on states to develop a legal system for the conscientious objection while the egyptian regime doesnt respect these laws future of the movement: when we achieve the objectives of the movement it will automatically converted to a specialized organization in defending the rights of recruits and workers in egyptian army site: wwwn4frcom facebook: wwwfacebookcom/groupphpgid=88554461720

59,97,سبعة نصائح للمشاركين في حملات الأفراج عن السجناء السياسيين,2015-01-27 00:00:00,Maikel Nabil,,0.480693,US,سبعة نصائح للمشاركين في حملات الأفراج عن السجناء السياسيين >> 27 january 2015 #fullpost{display:inline;} أهداء إلى رائف بدوي و وليد أبو الخير و سائر المعتقلين في المملكة العربية السعودية منذ أنفجار ثورة الياسمين في تونس في دسمبر 2010، و هناك صراع سياسي في منطقة شمال أفريقيا و الشرق الأوسط بين الأنظمة القمعية التي حكمت المنطقة منذ عقود، و بين مجموعات من النشطاء المطالبين بالتحول الديموقراطي و حقوق الأنسان هذا الصراع السياسي كان من أحدى نتائجه زيادة رهيبة في أعداد المعتقلين السياسيين في المنطقة مصر وحدها قُدر عدد المعتقلين السياسيين في العام الأخير فيها بأكثر من 40 ألف معتقل لا أحد يعلم بدقة أعداد المعتقلين السياسيين في المملكة العربية السعودية أو في الجمهورية العربية السورية حتى الدولة الإسلامية الناشئة أصبح لديها معتقلين محليين و أجانب، يشارك البعض في حملات للأفراج عنهم الكثير من الشباب و الكهول يجدون أنفسهم يوميا في أضطرار للمشاركة في حملة للأفراج عن صديق أو قريب أعتقلته أحد الأنظمة المستبدة بقوانينها القمعية قد أكون أنا أحد الأفراد القليلين الذين أختبروا المحلات السياسية من الأتجاهين، سجينا أحيانا و مدافعا عن السجناء في أحيان أخرى فمنذ عام 2005 و أنا أشارك أو أدير حملات للأفراج عن سجناء سياسيين بمصر و الدول المجاورة، و في نفس الوقت تم أعتقالي خمسة مرات بسبب نشاطي السياسي و أختبرت بنفسي أي الأدوات ساعدت في الأفراج عني و أي الأدوات كانت بلا جدوى و نظرا لأنه من الواضح أن القمع في طريقه للصعود أكثر و أكثر في دول المنطقة، فأعتقد أنه من المهم أن أشارك قراءي ببعض النصائح التي ستفيدهم أثناء مشاركتهم في أي من حملات الأفراج عن المعتقلين السياسيين 1- تأكد أولا من عدالة قضيتك أنت في طريقك لأن تستثمر وقتك و مجهودك و ربما نقودك في الدفاع عن قضية معينة قد تعرض حياتك أو سلامتك أو حريتك للخطر بسبب نشاطك هذا أذن يجب أولا أن تتأكد من أن ما ستقوم به يستحق المجهود و المخاطرة الذين ستخوضهما خذ وقتك في دراسة القضية التي أمامك أقرأ عن هذا المعتقل و عن سبب أعتقاله هل تم سجنه بسبب آراءة السياسية أو الدينية أم بسبب جريمة أرتكبها؟ أسأل نفسك، لو كان نفس الشخص أرتكب نفس الفعل في دولة ديموقراطية، هل كان سيتم أعتقاله أيضا؟ لا تنقاد مع القطيع ليس معنى أن هناك الكثيرين يدافعون عن شخص، أنه لم يرتكب جريمة في خلال السنوات السابقة، رأيت الكثيرين ممن قالوا أنهم ندموا لأشتراكهم في بعض حملات الأفراج عن بعض السجناء أنا شخصيا نادم على مطالبتي بحرية بعض الأفراد، بعد أن أكتشفت لاحقا أنهم لم يكونوا سجناء سياسيين و أنما معتقلين بسبب عنف مارسوه أو بسبب وجود دليل جاد يستحق التحفظ عليهم أثناء فترة التحقيق أن تقضي بضعة أيام تدرس قضيتك قبل العمل فيها، أفضل من أن تقضي شهورا متطوعا من أجل قضية ثم تندم باقي حياتك على ما فعلته الدفاع عن المشاركين في أعمال عنف قد يضر بنضالك السلمي غاندي في نضاله السلمي من أجل تحرير الهند من الأحتلال البريطاني كان يصر على أبعاد نفسه عن أي مناضل هندي يستخدم العنف ضد الأنجليز لا يمكنك أن تدعي أن نضالك سلمي و غير عنيف، و أنت في ذات الوقت تبرر السلوكيات العنيفة كل النضال السلمي الذي تقوم به سيكون بلا جدوى أذا ربط الناس بينك و بين شخص يمارس العنف 2- أعتقالك لن يفيد من تطالب بحريته يجب أن تدرك أن من تدافع عن حريته لن يستفيد شئ أذا ما تم أعتقالك بالعكس، أعتقالك سيزيد من عدد المعتقلين السياسيين، و سيزيد من أرهاق الحقوقيين و المدافعين عن المعتقلين السياسيين طالما أنت حر، فبأمكانك أن تبذل مجهودا، مهما كان قليلا، من أجل حرية السجناء السياسيين و لكن أذا ما تم سجنك، فمن تطالب بحريته سيخسر واحدا ممن يعملون على حريته الحملات السياسية ليست مكانا للأستعراض السياسي أو التنافس على دور البطولة، و أنما حملات براجماتية لها أهداف محددة و واضحة المثال الأفضل على ذلك هو الصراع القائم في مصر حاليا على قانون التظاهر القانون بالطبع قاسي ولا يوجد مثيل له في الأنظمة الحرة لكن رد الفعل الأستعراضي لم يساهم في تغيير القانون نظاهر بعض النشطاء بدون تصريح تحديا للقانون، فتم الحكم عليهم بالسجن فتظاهر أفراد آخرين بدون تصريح مطالبين بالأفراج عمن سبق القبض عليهم، فتم القبض على المتظاهرين الجدد و الحكم عليهم بالسجن ماذا أستفاد السجناء السابقين من سجن مجموعة جديدة من النشطاء بسبب نفس القانون الظالم؟ بالعكس، بعض السجناء الجدد أصبحوا أكثر شهرة من السجناء السابقين، و نسى الناس من تم أعتقالهم أولا السياسة هي فن الممكن، و عليك أن تفكر في الأداة التي يمكنك من خلالها الوصول لهدفك بدون أن تضر أحدا، و ليست أندفاع أهوج مع القطيع للتنافس فيمن أكثر ثورية 3- الحملات الأعلامية أهم من قاعة المحكمة أعتقد أنك تعرف مسبقا أن القضاء في دول المنطقة ليس مستقلا، و أن معظم أحكامه مسيسة في حالات أستثنائية نادرة، يقرر أحد القضاء الشرفاء الأفراج عن شخص برئ أعتقلته السلطات، و لكن هذا هو الأستثناء من القاعدة الواقع أن المعتقلين السياسيين يتم الأفراج عنهم حينما يكون هناك ضغط كافي على الأنظمة السياسية من أجل الأفراج عن المعتقلين لذلك لا تستنفذ وقتك و مجهودك في التعامل مع البيروقراطية داخل المحاكم و المجادلات القانونية جميع الحملات التي شاركت فيها أنتهت بقرار سياسي، و الأفراج عني شخصيا كان يتم بقرار سياسي و ليس بقرار قضائي المحاميين قد يستهلكون وقتك الثمين الذي يمكن أستخدامه في بدائل أكثر جدوى في المحاكمتين العسكريتين التي خضتهما لم يكن هناك دليلا ماديا ضدي، و مع ذلك تم الحكم ضدي لأسباب سياسية و بعدها تم العفو عني بقرار رئاسي لأسباب سياسية أيضا أدراكي أن الحملات الأعلامية هي من يمكن أن تحررني، كان السبب في أني قاطعت محاكمتي أمام القضاء العسكري في أغسطس 2011 مهما كنت قدمت أدلة تثبت براءتي للمحكمة، كانت المحكمة ستدينني لأسباب سياسية ببساطة، أستهلك مجهودك في خلق ضغط سياسي، و أترك المحاكم و الألعاب القانونية للمحاميين فهم أدرى بها 4- السكوت لا ينفع أبدا بعد كل حادثة أعتقال سياسي، ستجد أحد الأفراد يدعي أنه صديق و حريص على مصلحة صديقك المعتقل، و ينصحك بالبعد عن الشوشرة قد يكون أحد الأقارب أو الأصدقاء أو المحاميين أو حتى أحد أفراد النظام الحاكم سيقول لك أن صديقك المعتقل ليس من مصلحته وجود ضوضاء في الأعلام سيقول لك أن صديقك سيخرج قريبا أذا صمتت انت، و ان الحملات الأعلامية ستدفع السلطات لمزيد من العناد قد يعرض عليك تدخله الشخصي من أجل حرية صديقك في مقابل أن تصمت تماما ببساطة، هذا الشخص يطلب منك أن تتخلى عن سلاحك الوحيد الصراخ للأسف، الأنظمة القمعية لا تفهم إلا لغة القوة اذا كنت ضعيفا، ستزيد الأنظمة قمعا أستسلامك و توافقك سيجعل الأنظمة تطمع أكثر فيك يقول المثل: أذا أعطيت للشيطان أصبعك، فسيأخذ يدك كلها أنا شخصيا لا أفضل أسخدام القوة العنيفة، لأنها ببساطة ستعطي للأنظمة مبررا لأستخدام المزيد من العنف اللاعنف يمثل قوة لا يستهان بها في العمل السياسي، و يسميه البعض القوة الناعمة الحملات الأعلامية هي مصدر قوتك، و قوتك هي اللغة الوحيدة التي يفهمها النظام القمعي حينما تصمت، فأنت ببساطة تترك سلاحك الوحيد و كلما يعتقد النظام القمعي أنك ضعيف، سيزيد قمعه لك لقد شاركت في عشرات الحملات من أجل الأفراج عن المعتقلين السياسيين، و لم أمر بحالة واحدة كان فيها السكوت لمصلحة السجين السياسي بالعكس، السكوت كان دائما يسمح للسلطات بالتنكيل بالمعتقل في صمت و هدوء لا تذبح صديقك بصمتك 5- الكم و الكيف كلاهما لا يمكن الأستغناء عنهما في الحملات الأعلامية، يهدف معظم الأشخاص في الحصول على تضامن أكبر مجموعة ممكنة من البشر يستخدم النشطاء وسائل التواصل الأجتماعي لتوصيل رسائلهم و يطالبون الجمهور بالمشاركة في بعض الأنشطة التي تؤكد على تضامنهم جمع التوقيعات على بيانات للمطالبة بالأفراج عن أحد المعتقلين هو أهم الأدوات التي يستعرض بها المشاركين حجم التضامن مع قضيتهم لكن الذي يهمله الكثيرين هو أن نوعية المتضامنين لا تقل أهمية عن عددهم يجب أن تستثمر جزءا من مجهودك للحصول على تضامن الأفراد و المنظمات ذوي القوة السياسية، كالسياسيين و الحقوقيين و الفنانين و الرموز الدينية و الأعلاميين بالطبع، أولئك الأشخاص لن يعطونك تضامنهم بسهولة، و قد تستهلك وقتك محاولا أقناعهم بلا جدوى و لكن في نفس الوقت أنضمام أحدهم لحملتك سيعطيها قوة معنوية غير قليلة المشاهير ليسوا هم الفئة الوحيدة التي تحتاج لتضامنها ما تحتاجه أكثر هو التضامن من الأشخاص المختلفين معك سياسيا أذا كان المتضامنين مع حملتك هم فقط أفراد من تيارك السياسي أو الديني، فأن قضيتك سيتقبلها الناس على أنها قضية تخص جماعة معينة أنت تحتاج أن تجعل قضيتك قضية أنسانية يتفق عليها الجميع بغض النظر عن أختلافاتهم السياسية و الدينية كلما كان الشخص أكثر أختلافا معك في الرأي الديني أو السياسي، كلما كان تأثير تأييده لحملتك أكبر لأنه وقتها ستكون القضية أمام الرأي العام قضية حقوق أنسان و ليست قضية فصيل سياسي أو ديني محدد 6- لا تقلل من شأن قضيتك أبدا يجب أن تدرك أنك لا تستطيع أن تقنع الناس بقضيتك ما لم تكن أنت نفسك مقتنعا بها و لا يمكنك أن تجعل الناس يحترمون من تدافع عنه، ما لم تحترمه أنت أولا لا تقلل من شأن قضيتك أبدا أذا كانت قضيتك عادلة، فلا تخجل منها، ولا تستخدم أساليب تقلل من قيمتها على سبيل المثال، يطالب البعض بالأفراج عن فلان لأنه سنه صغير أو لأنها بنت أو لأن مستقبله هيضيع هذة المبررات تقلل من قيمة القضية فلان يجب أن يكون حرا لأنه برئ، و ليس لأنه صغير السن أو أنثي أو طالب أذا لم يكن هذا الشخص بريئا، فالعدالة أن يتم سجنه بغض النظر عن سنه أو جنسه أو وضعة الدراسي نفس الشئ يقال عن المضربين عن الطعام المعتقل السياسي المضرب عن الطعام يجب أن يتم أطلاق سراحه لأنه برئ، و ليس حفاظا على حياته أذا أضرب قاتل أو أرهابي أو مغتصب عن الطعام مطالبا بالحرية، فليس من المعقول أن يتم أطلاق سراحه حفاظا على حياته الشخص المضرب عن الطعام لو كان يكترث للحفاظ على حياته ما كان أضرب عن الطعام أصلا القضية هي كون الشخص برئ أو غير برئ أستخدامك لأعذار تقلل من قيمة قضيتك سيضعف حجم التعاطف مع قضيتك، و سيقلل من أقتناع الناس مع عدالتها 7- التحالفات مصدر قوتك الأهم تختلف حملات الأفراج عن المعتقلين السياسيين في قوتها و حجمها حسب عوامل كثيرة بعض الحملات تنجح في تحقيق هدفها و الأفراج عن المعتقلين في خلال ساعات بعض الحملات الأخرى قد تضطر للأستمرار لسنوات حتى يستجيب النظام القمعي للضغوط أذا لم تكن محظوظا، فأنت أمام طريق شاق و مجهود كبير للوصول إلى هدفك و لذلك فأنت تحتاج لبناء تحالفات مع مجموعات أخرى منظمة العمل بمفردك سيكون أكثر أرهاقا و أقل ثمارا من العمل من خلال تحالفات أذا كنت تنتمي لأقلية دينية، لماذا لا تتواصل مع الأقليات الدينية الأخرى و تتحالف معهم؟ يمكنك أن تتضامن معهم في قضاياهم، في مقابل أن يتضامنون معك في قضيتك أذا كنت تنتمي لحزب سياسي، أعرض التحالف على الأحزاب السياسية الأخرى بالتأكيد هناك العديد من المعتقلين السياسيين في بلدك أو في الدول المجاورة تحالف مع حملات الأفراج عنهم ساعدهم في أنشطتهم للأفراج عن معتقليهم، في مقابل أن يساعدوك هم في أنشطتك للأفراج عمن تدافع عن حريته في بناء التحالفات يجب أن تدرك شيئين مهمين أولا: أنك يجب أن تقدم شيئا أذا لم تقدم للآخرين تضامنا أو دعما، فلن يكون لديهم دافع للتحالف مع حملتك ثانيا: لا تدع أحد يستغلك نعم التحالفات تقتضي أن تقدم مساعده ة دعمك لحلفائك و قضاياهم، و لكن دون أن يقلل هذا من تركيزك في قضيتك الأساسية و هي حرية المعتقل السياسي الذي تشارك في حملة الأفراج عنه عليك أذن أن تخلق توازنا بين ما تقدم لحلفاءك و ما يقدمونه لك خاتمة نحن محظوظين لأننا لا نعيش في العصور الوسطى، في الأوقات التي كان فيها المخالفون يتم حرقهم أو شنقهم فورا و لكني لا أعتقد أننا سنكون محظوظين بالقدر الكافي لنرى يوما كوكب الأرض بلا سجناء سياسيين أنه قدرنا أن نعيش باقي حياتنا ندافع عن سجناء سياسيين في كل مكان، في سوريا أو كوريا أو فينزويلا، أو في أي مكان آخر من باقي بقاع ذلك الكوكب الذي يأبى أن يعيش يوما بلا قهر posted by maikel nabil sanad at 12:45 am

60,98,الحركة المعارضة للتجنيد الإجباري في مصر تكتسب زخما جديدا,2015-01-26 00:00:00,Maikel Nabil,,-0.002497,US,الحركة المعارضة للتجنيد الإجباري في مصر تكتسب زخما جديدا >> 26 january 2015 #fullpost{display:inline;} كل سلاح يتم تصنيعه، و كل سفينة حربية يتم أطلاقها، كل صاروخ يتم أطلاقه، هو مال مسروق من الجائعين الذين لا يجدون طعاما الرئيس الأمريكي الأسبق أيزنهاور معترض ضميري جديد يوم السبت 10 يناير 2015، أعلن مارك نبيل سند – 22 عام – أعتراضه الضميري على الخدمة العسكرية في مصر، و أستعداده لتحمل نتائج قراره خطوة ليست شائعة في مصر مارك في بيانه ذكر أنه يعتبر رفضه للخدمة العسكرية مسئولية تجاه اجيال قادمة يجب الا تورث هذه العبودية المسماة التجنيد الاجباري البيان ذكر خمسة أسباب لرفض الخدمة العسكرية أهمها رفض أستخدام العنف لحل الصراعات، و رفض الأنضمام لمؤسسة لها تاريخ في أنتهاك حقوق الأنسان بمصر، و كذا رفضه لأستخدام الجيش المصري للمدنيين كدروع بشرية من خلال وضع نقاطه العسكرية ضمن المناطق السكنية كان مارك قد مثل لأجراءات الكشف الطبي بمنطقة تجنيد أسيوط في مايو الماضي طبقا للقانون، وقتها قام بأبلاغ المسئولين بالمنطقة عن رفضه للتجنيد الإجباري و لدور الجيش بعد أنقلاب يوليو 2013 تم توقيف مارك مباشرة و أحتجازة لعدة ساعات بمكتب المخابرات الحربية بمنطقة تجنيد أسيوط، أعقبه تحقيقا آخرا بمقر المخابرات الحربية برابعة العدوية بالقاهرة أدارة التجنيد و التعبئة قررت بعدها تعليق أجراءات تجنيده، و لكنها منذ ذلك الوقت ترفض تسليمه أي مستند قانوني ينص على موقفة النهائي من الخدمة العسكرية و بدون هذا المستند يظل مارك حتى اليوم ممنوعا قانونا من الدراسة أو العمل أو السفر للخارج الرد الأول من نوعه مصطفى أحمد السعيد هو أيضا أحد الشباب الرافضين للخدمة العسكرية الإجبارية يوم الخميس 27 نوفمبر 2014 تلقى مصطفى ردا رسميا من أدارة التجنيد و التعبئة بوزارة الدفاع بخصوص طلبه أستثناء من الخدمة العسكرية بناء على معتقداته الضميرية المتمثلة في السلمية و اللاعنف الرد يمثل حدثا فريدا بأعتبارة أول رد مكتوب من الجيش المصري على طلب أعتراض ضميري على الخدمة العسكرية كان الجيش المصري قد تجاهل كل الخطابات المماثلة من المعترضين الضميريين، سواء التي أرسلتها أنا قبل رفضي للخدمة العسكرية في أكتوبر 2010، أو التى أرسلها عماد الدفراوي و محمد فتحي بعد رفضهم للخدمة العسكرية في 2012 كان مصطفى أحمد السعيد قد تم ترشيحه للخدمة كضابط أحتياط بعد أجتيازه للكشف الطبي بمنطقة تجنيد الزقازيق بعدها أرسل مصطفى خطابا للفريق أول صدقي صبحي وزير الدفاع و الأنتاج الحربي بتاريخ 12 نوفمبر، يطلب فيه أستثناؤه من الخدمة العسكرية بناء على المادة 54 من الدستور المصري التي تضمن الحرية الشخصية مصطفى أشار إلى أن نظام التجنيد الإجباري يُعد نوعا من السخرة و العبودية، معلنا رفضه المشاركة في الحروب و انتشار العنف و سفك دماء أي طرف بعد ساعات من تلقيه رد أدارة التجنيد و التعبئة، تلقى مصطفى أتصالا هاتفيا من مندوب التجنيد بقسم الشرطة التابع له يطلب حضورة لأستدعاء أمني بمنطقة تجنيد الزقازيق رد أدارة التجنيد و التعبئة أعتبر محاولة رفض التجنيد الإجباري يدل على عدم الأنتماء لهذا الوطن و تهديد لأمنه و سلامته من الأخطار المحيطة حركة لا للتجنيد الإجباري كانت الحركة المناهضة للتجنيد الإجباري قد بدأت في عام 2006 بكتابات المدون كريم عامر الناقدة لنظام التجنيد القسري، و الداعية لتحول الجيش المصري لنظام تجنيد أختياري كريم أختفى عن الساحة السياسية بعدها بفتره قصيرة بعد الحكم عليه بالسجن لأربعة سنوات بسبب كتاباته المناهضة للدين و لنظام مبارك في 2009، قمت مع مجموعة من الليبراليين المصريين تأسيس حركة لا للتجنيد الإجباري كأول تنظيم مصري مناهض للعسكرية و لنظام التجنيد القسري في 20 أكتوبر 2010، كنت أول مصري يرفض الخدمة العسكرية بعد أن تم ترشيحي للخدمة كضابط أحتياط الشرطة العسكرية خطفتني من منزلي بالقاهرة بعدها بثلاث أسابيع، و تم أعفائي نهائيا من الخدمة العسكرية بدعوى عدم لياقتي النفسية للخدمة بالقوات المسلحة في 2012، قام كل من عماد الدفراوي و محمد فتحي برفض الخدمة العسكرية بسبب معتقداتهم السلامية الرافضة للعنف أو حمل السلاح الجيش كان رد فعله مختلفا وقتها، فقرر أن يتجاهل موقفهما من التجنيد تاركا أياهم في وضع غير قانوني لأكثر من عامان عاش كلاهما محرومين من الحق في العمل أو التعليم أو السفر أثناء تلك الفترة أعلنت العديد من المنظمات المناهضة للعسكرية في أوربا و إسرائيل تضامنها مع المعترضين الضميريين أخلع بعد أنقلاب عبد الفتاح السيسي في يوليو 2013 و أزاحة الرئيس الإسلامي محمد مرسي، بدأت بوادر التمرد على الخدمة العسكرية بين التيارات الإسلامية تظهر تدريجيا مؤخرا أنشأ بعض شباب التيارات الإسلامية حركة جديدة مناهضة للتجنيد الإجباري بعنوان أخلع الحركة الجديدة تدعو لرفض نظام التجنيد الإجباري، و تدعو المجندين لترك مواقعهم داخل الجيش الحركة الجديدة تمثل طفرة في خطاب الحركات الإسلامية في مصر، حيث دأب الإسلاميين في مصر على تمجيد الحياة العسكرية و القتال تحت مسمى الجهاد، و في السنوات السابقة كان الإسلاميين معارضين بشدة لحركة لا للتجنيد الإجباري حركة أخلع على النقيض تنادي بأن التجنيد حرام مستنده على حديث لرسول الإسلام يقول فيه يكون في آخر الزمان أمراء ظلمة و وزراء فسقة و قضاة خونة و فقهاء كذبة، فمن أدرك منكم ذلك الزمان فلا يكونن لهم جابيا ولا عريفا ولا شرطيا الحركة الجديدة تمثل نقيضا فكريا لحركة لا للتجنيد الإجباري فبينما يؤمن أفراد حركة لا للتجنيد الإجباري بالسلامية و رفض حمل السلاح، يستخدم أعضاء حركة أخلع صورا و شعارات مؤيدة للدولة الإسلامية بسوريا و العراق، بالأضافة لصور زعيمها أبو بكر البغدادي و بينما تدعم حركة لا للتجنيد الإجباري خطابا متصالحا مع الغرب و إسرائيل، تنتهج أخلع خطابا معاديا للغرب و إسرائيل في 1 يناير 2015، أعلنت حركة أخلع عن أول ضابط يستجيب لدعوات الحركة و يترك الخدمة بالجيش المصري المقدم تامر بدر أصدر بيانا يقول فيه أن أستقالته من الجيش المصري كات بسبب رفضه لسياسة قيادات الجيش تجاه الثورة، و كذا لأنه لا أستعداد لديه لتوجيه سلاحه تجاه المصريين و قد كان تامر بدر قد سُجن لفترة تزيد عن العام و النصف بعد مشاركته في تظاهرة عسكرية بميدان التحرير في 8 أبريل 2011 متى يبدأ التغيير؟ منذ كتب كريم عامر مقالاته المناهضة للتجنيد في 2006، لم ينجح الجيش المصري في فرض الخدمة العسكرية على أي رافض للخدمة العسكرية كل من رفضوا التجنيد الإجباري تم أعفاؤهم من الخدمة العسكرية بعد أن دفعوا ثمنا ليس بهين، و لكنه أهون من الثمن الذي يدفعه الجنود المصريين بسيناء الجيش لم يحاكم أي سلامي مصري بسبب رفضه لحمل السلاح أصبح من الواضح أن الجيش يتجنب ما يمكن أن يكون أول محاكمة لمعترض ضميري في تاريخ مصر تنازل الجيش المصري عن موقفه المتشدد المتمسك بنظام التجنيد الإجباري ليس إلا مسألة وقت تاريخيا، كل الجيوش تمسكت بنظام التجنيد الإجباري و لكن منذ نهاية الحرب العالمية الثانية، بدأت الجيوش تخضع لقيم الحداثة و الأحترافية الجيش الأمريكي قبل بإنهاء نظام التجنيد الإجباري عام 1973 الجيش الفرنسي قبل بنفس الشئ عام 1996 الجيش الألماني قبل بذلك مؤخرا في 2012 و الجيش المصري سيضطر يوما ما للقبول بنظام تجنيد أحترافي بدلا من النظام الحالي السؤال الحقيق ليس أذا ما كان الجيش سيتنازل عن موقفه المتشدد، و أنما متى سيتنازل عن موقفه المتشدد؟ الأجابة على هذا السؤال ستعتمد على عدد الشباب المصري الذي سيرفض الخدمة العسكرية علنا في السنوات القليلة المقبلة posted by maikel nabil sanad at 1:11 am labels: articles

#fullpost{display:inline;} بعد أستقلال الصومال عام 1960، كان العديد من الصوماليون يحلمون بالديموقراطية آنذاك، أنتشرت في الصومال العديد من التنظيمات الديموقراطية، و مرت الدولة بتداول سلمي للسلطة أكثر من مرة إلا أن أحلام الصوماليين بالديموقراطية أنتهت مع أنقلاب الجيش في 1969، و الذي أسس لحكم عسكري دموي أستمر لمدة 21 عام الأتحاد السوفيتي و الدول الناطقة بالعربية أختاروا أن يدعموا الدكتاتورية الجديدة، و أختار العالم أن يتعامى على جرائم تلك الدكتاتورية في عام 1991، من خلال ثورة مسلحة تمكن الصوماليين من خلع الدكتاتور العسكري محمد سياد بري و لكن، كما يحدث في معظم الأنظمة الجديدة، أختلف الصوماليون على شكل الدولة الجديدة، و من هنا بدأت حرب أهلية طاحنة لاتزال دائرة حتى اليوم، و إن كانت خفت حدتها الصومال اليوم تتصدر قائمة الدول الفاشلة، قتل فيها نصف مليون شخص في الحرب الأهلية، و تشرد منها مليون لاجئ يعيشون في الدول المجاورة، بالأضافة إلى مليون و نص شخص مشرد داخليا الحكومة الصومالية لا تسيطر على معظم الأراضي الصومالية، بل أحيانا بعض أجزاء من العاصمة مقديشو تخرج عن سيطرتها فشل السلطات الصومالية في أدارة البلاد سمح للقراصنة الصوماليين بممارسة جرائمهم في البحر، و للقاعدة و غيرها من التنظيمات الإرهابية في إنشاء معسكراتها في البر الصراع العسكري الدائم و المجاعات و اللاجئين و الأرهاب، كلها قضايا جعلت الديموقراطية في مؤخرة أولويات السلطات الصومالية و المجتمع الدولي الحركات الديموقراطية في الصومال كانت هي الضحية الكبرى لكل ما حدث في الصومال منذ أنقلاب 1969 تعرضت تلك التنظيمات للقمع 21 عاما على يد الدكتاتورية العسكرية وسط صمت العالم، و مع بداية الحرب الأهلية أصبح الديموقراطيين هدف للعسكريين و الإسلاميين في نفس الوقت الحرب لأهلية جعلت للرشاش قيمة أعلى من صندوق الأقتراع و حتى اليوم فأن ما يشغل العالم، ليس الديموقراطية، بل أقامة سلطة قوية في الصومال تسيطر على الامن و تسترجع اللاجئين مع أن الصومال لن تستقر إلا بنظام ديموقراطي توافقي ينهي الصراع لكن الصوماليين لم يدفعوا وحدهم ثمن عدم الأستقرار في وطنهم، بل معظم دول القرن الأفريقي بل و حتى الدول الكبرى ففي عام 1977 غزا العسكر الصوماليين أثيوبيا ضمن أحلامهم التوسعية و مع الحرب الأهلية، بدأ العالم يدفع فواتير للتدخل العسكري أكثر من مرة إما لحفظ السلام و إما للتخلص من الحركات الإسلامية المسلحة، و فواتير الأنفاق على ما يقرب من مليون لاجئ صومالي هربوا من الحرب الأهلية و أرهقوا الدول المجاورة أقتصاديا، و فواتير مكافحة القراصنة الصوماليين و تأثيرهم السلبي على التجارة في غرب المحيط الهندي، و فواتير مكافحة الحركات الأرهابية التي أصبحت الصومال أحد بؤرها الحقيقة أننا كلنا شاركنا، بشكل أو بآخر، في دفع فاتورة عدم وجود ديموقراطية مستقرة في الصومال بعد أسقاط الدكتاتور محمد حسنى مبارك في مصر، أختلف المحللون أن كانت مصر ستسير وفقا للتجربة التركية حيث يسيطر الجيش على الأمور العسكرية و يحمي عالمانية الدولة بينما يسمح بحكومة منتخبة ديموقراطية، أم التجربة الأيرانية حيث نجح الإسلاميين في السيطرة تماما على الجيش و أجهزة المخابرات و أخضاعهم، أم التجربة الباكستانية حيث تقاسم الجيش و الإسلاميين السلطة و لكن على أرضية ثيئوقراطية و ليس عالمانية كتركيا في الحقيقة، أن مصر لا تسير في طريق تركيا أو أيران أو حتى باكستان حتى يونيو الماضي كانت المؤشرات تقول أن مصر تسير طبق النموذج الباكستاني في تقاسم للسلطه بين الجيش و الإسلاميين على أساس ديني، إلا أن أنقلاب 3 يوليو نقل مصر من النموذج الباكستاني للنموذج الصومالي من حيث وجود صؤاع لا نهائي بين العسكر و الإسلاميين ففي مصر، الديموغرافيا و البطالة تجعل الأحتجاجات الشعبية مأزق لا مفر منه، و تدهور الأقتصاد جعل الكعكة صغيرة جدا بحيث لا تسمح بالقسمة بين العسكر و الإسلاميين، و تفكك الدولة المصرية جعل الصراع الداخلي بين أجهزة المخابرات المصرية المختلفة أشبة بالحرب الأهلية و كما حدث في الصومال، يتم سحق الحركة الديموقراطية المصرية بين مطرقة الجيش و سندان الإسلاميين فالدكتاتورية العسكرية قمعت الديموقراطيين لأكثر من ستون عاما، في الوقت الذي تبنت فيه أفكار الإسلاميين جاعله الشريعة الإسلامية مصدرا للتشريع و سمحت خلالها بمزايا نسبية للإسلاميين و بعد وصول الإسلاميين للسلطة، أستمر الأخوان المسلمين في سحق الحركة الديموقراطية المصرية و سجن و نفي أفرادها و بعد أنقلاب يوليو 2013، عاد الجيش ليصادر الحريات الفردية و العامة تحت أدعاءات محاربة الإرهاب و بعكس الإسلاميين، لا يتمتع الديموقراطيين في مصر بدعم أي دولة أجنبية فأدعاءات الأتحاد الأروربي و الولايات المتحدة بدعم التحول الديموقراطي في مصر لا تزيد عن كونها بروباجاندا سياسية في الوقت الذي تقوم فيه تلك الدول بتمويل و تسليح الدكتاتورية المصرية لقد أصبح واضحا أن الأمور في مصر لن تسير للأحسن القمع الغير المبرر الذي يستخدمه الجيش المصري ضد الأخوان المسلمين، و خصوصا الأطفال منهم، جلب لهم المزيد من التعاطف و من المتوقع أيضا أن يخلق الدستور الجديد أنقساما مضاعفا، فالعالمانيين لن يقبلوا بالنصوص الدينية في الدستور، ولا الديموقراطيين سيقبلون بالسلطات التي منحها الدستور الجديد للجيش الضغط الدولي على مصر دفع الدولة للبحث عن داعم بين دول الخليج و روسيا و الصين الوضع الأقتصادي المتردي قد يقود لمجاعات و فوضي الأقليات المسيحية و الشيعية قد تتعرض أيضا لمذابح و للتهجير و من غير المستبعد أن يلجأ الجيش المصري لإلغاء معاهدة السلام مع إسرائيل، كوسيلة لأستخدام الأيديولوجية القومية في القمع الداخلي، و لإيجاد مبرر لتجنيد ملايين الشباب الذين يشاركون في التظاهرات بشكل دوري، و لأبتزاز العالم من جديد للحصول على ثمن جديد لتوقيع أتفاقية سلام جديدة مع إسرائيل الأقتصاد و عدم الأستقرار السياسي، مع ضعف سيطرة الدولة على الحدود، سيدفع بمئات الألوف و ربما الملايين من اللاجئين لشواطئ أوربا حينها التدخل العسكري الأجنبي في مصر لن يكون مستبعدا في بداية القرن الماضي، كانت ألمانيا مصدر لعدم الأستقرار في أوربا، و تسببت في حربين عالميتين و مذابح راح ضحيتهم أكثر من 100 مليون شخص لم تستقر أوربا إلا في عام 1949 بصدور الدستور الألماني موقعا من الدول الغربية المنتصرة في الحرب العالمية الثانية هذة القوى ذاتها أختارت ألا تبني في الصومال ديموقراطية مثل ألمانيا، تاركة أياها مصدر لعدم الأستقرار في القرن الأفريقي، و يبدو أن هذة القوة ستكرر نفس الخطأ تاركة سوريا مصدرا لعدم الإستقرار في منطقة شرق المتوسط للأسف، مصر لن تستقر إلا أذا أتفقت نفس القوى مضافا إليها القوى الأقليمية كالسعودية و إسرائيل على خريطة طريق لدمقرطة مصر هذا و إلا ستدفع تلك الدول ثمنا كثمن عدم أستقرار ألمانيا و الصومال تم نشر أجزاء من هذا المقال باللغة

Comunicato Antimilitariste e Antimilitaristi sul campeggio e il corteo antimilitarista a Cagliari",2015-10-15 00:00:00,NoBordersard,,0.439527,ES,nonostante la pioggia ottobre è un mese caldo le mobilitazioni si stanno susseguendo su vari fronti aperti nella città di cagliari e sul territorio: antifascismo antimilitarismo movimento di lotta per la casa supporto alle lotte dei migranti e contestazioni studentesche la rete no basi né qui né altrove dopo un anno di mobilitazioni antimilitariste in sardegna ha lanciato una campagna di iniziative che è partita il 3 ottobre con la giornata no war – no border in solidarietà alla resistenza delle frontiere in italia e in europa ha proseguito con l’organizzazione del campeggio antimilitarista in vista della mobilitazione contro l’esercitazione trident juncture la più imponente esercitazione nato degli ultimi 15 anni programmata dall’alleanza prevede una intensissima stagione di esercitazioni e addestramenti anche in sardegna dove avverranno pesanti bombardamenti di aria mare e terra con le conseguenze devastanti per il territorio e per la salute che qui già ben conosciamo questa esercitazione si inserisce nella strategia generale di riarmo e sviluppo di nuovi strumenti aggressivi intrapresa a partire dal vertice nato tenutosi in galles a settembre 2014 con la progettazione di nuove guerre e altri morti in risposta a questo fermento è emersa chiaramente la volontà delle forze repressive di soffocare qualsiasi forma di opposizione le misure adottate dalla forza pubblica prima durante e dopo il campeggio antimilitarista che si è svolto il 91011 ottobre a cagliari sono state un’avvisaglia di come intenda gestire il “problema” di chi lotta contro l’esistente sono sopraggiunte diverse richieste di sorveglianza speciale per gli attivisti della rete no basi i compagni venuti in sardegna in solidarietà alla lotta antimilitarista sono stati accolti in aeroporto con fogli di via preventivi avvisi orali perquisizioni e controlli una impressionante militarizzazione del centro della città ha preceduto e accompagnato la 3 giorni del campeggio oltre alle operazioni di routine siamo stati oggetto di azioni intimidatorie degne dei più squallidi film sui gangster: gomme squarciate minacce verbali e mai troppo velate richieste di collaborazione il momento culminante dell’operazione portata avanti dall’apparato poliziesco è stato il corteo della domenica organizzato dal campeggio di seguito un resoconto breve racconto di una carica manifestazione antimilitarista a cagliari domenica 11 ottobre 2015 la manifestazione è partita regolarmente da piazza d’armi verso le 19 in una zona universitaria che di domenica sera è poco popolata il corteo è stato subito seguito da un nutrito gruppo di agenti digos-ros cui si sono aggiunti quasi subito i reparti celere e poi anche i carabinieri in assetto antisommossa che comunque si sono limitati a seguirci per tutto viale merello e viale fra’ ignazio e poi in corso vittorio emanuele mano a mano che ci avvicinavamo alle zone più centrali e trafficate della città si poteva però notare come l’atteggiamento degli agenti stesse diventando più aggressivo e nervoso mentre si avvicinavano sempre più alla coda del corteo che aveva raggiunto un centinaio di persone quando abbiamo imboccato via mameli che ci avrebbe portato nel largo carlo felice e in piazza yenne è partita quasi subito una violenta carica alle spalle del corteo cui poi ne sono seguite altre l’atteggiamento degli sbirri era contraddittorio da una parte ci intimavano di scioglierci dall’altra rendevano impossibile lo scioglimento incalzandoci da dietro e schierandosi a bloccare l’uscita della stessa via mameli nella quale ci trovavamo evidentemente avevano l’ordine di non farci raggiungere il centro della città (largo carlo felice e piazza yenne) in quel momento affollato di persone in qualche modo nonostante le cariche il corteo è proseguito sino a piazza del carmine dove si è potuto finalmente fermare ricompattarsi per poi sciogliersi le forze del dis-ordine a quel punto si sono lanciate in un’ultima ridicola esibizione di forza e di stupidità lanciandosi (secondo loro) all’inseguimento dei manifestanti che andavano sciogliendosi abbiamo assistito all’arrivo di sei furgoni carichi di agenti antisommossa all’imboccatura di via sardegna dove gli agenti sono scesi poi in gran fretta gli sbirri hanno formato una doppia schiera e si sono lanciati in una carica… in mezzo al nulla tra i tavolini dei bar e la gente impaurita ma anche allibita che li sbeffeggiava nonostante l’aggressività e i pestaggi siamo riusciti a non subire né feriti gravi né arresti il giorno dopo tutte le scritte vecchie e nuove che si trovavano lungo il percorso della manifestazione erano state cancellate dalla squadra imbianchini della questura mentre erano ancora visibili le macchie prodotte nella facciata della sede della croce rossa italiana in viale merello (la cri risulta coinvolta nella manovra militare trident juncture2015 come organizzazione collegata alla nato) hanno provato ad intimidirci nascondono le tracce del dissenso con la paura che la mobilitazione si allarghi sempre di più perchè sanno che i poligoni sardi e non solo producono impoverimento e morte i nostri obiettivi restano chiari e le iniziative continueranno come da programma

dopo di che si è scatenata la rabbia ma il nostro sdegno non finisce qui purtroppo conosciamo quale è spesso l’agire delle “forze dell’ordine” e’ stato ancora più brucianteseguendo i vari notiziari dell’ 11/06 sentire notizie false e tendenziose: c’erano più di 100 blackbloc venuti da non so dove;
